            <p>An audio narrative, based on my Tomb of Annihilation campaign, that tells the story of two explorers trekking through the jungle when they come across the titular jungle tyrant, a Tyrannosaurus Rex. (If you are keeping up with my ToA session logs, Wallace and Evelyn are based on the those characters. And voiced by their players!)</p>
            <p>This project was created using Audacity for my Composing Digital Media class. The audio, Audacity project file, transcript of the audio, and credits are available at the repository.</p>

A political map of Pennsylvania has a glass fracture pattern overlaid on it. The words 'The rules of democracy are broken' are placed above that. In the corner, the words 'Learn more' point to a QR code.">

            <p>A visual argument exploring the fractured nature of Pennsylvanian/US politics and the state of democracy. Originally intended as commentary on gerrymandering, the project expanded in scope as it progressed.</p>
            <p>This project was created using GIMP for my Composing Digital Media class. The image file (.png), GIMP project file, credits, and links for additional information on gerrymandering, voter suppression, and more, are available at the repository.</p>
