            <p>My name is Evan Kozierok, and welcome to my website! I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science and plan to graduate in December 2023. I had the amazing opportunity this summer to work for VISIMO as a Data Science & Analytics Intern, and learned a lot about various data science and AI practices. For more of my professional work, head to my Resume page!</p>
            <p>In terms of less academic ventures, I sing upper Bass for the <a target="_blank" href="http://pittmensgleeclub.com">Pitt Men's Glee Club</a>, which I was proud to serve as the President of last year and the Secretary before that. I am enough of a nerd that I have an entire section of my website devoted to Dungeons and Dragons, so check out some session logs for my now-finished campaign of Tomb of Annihilation there, and if I ever actually finish homebrew or other projects those will go there too. You can head to my Other Work page for various miscellaneous projects I've done that don't necessarily fit within a CS resume, including work from my Composing Digital Media class, which is what actually forced my hand to write this website, a task I'd long wanted to do and long procrastinated doing. And for more random insights into me, check out my extended About Me.</p>
