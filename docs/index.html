                <p>My name is Evan Kozierok, and welcome to my website, currently under construction. I am a second-year student at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. I am currently an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for both Intermediate Programming in Java and Big Ideas in Computing and Information at Pitt, and in previous semesters I have also been a UTA for Discrete Structures. This summer, I am pleased to be working for Wells Fargo doing web development and UI/UX design. For more of my professional work, head to the Interactive Resume! (interactivity coming soon to a resume near you)</p>
                <p>In terms of less academic ventures, I am the secretary for the <a target="_blank" href="http://pittmensgleeclub.com">Pitt Men's Glee Club</a>, where I sing lower Baritone. I am enough of a nerd that I have an entire section of my website devoted to Dungeons and Dragons, so check out some session logs for my campaign of Tomb of Annihilation there, and if I ever actually finish homebrew or other projects those will go there too. You can head to my Other Work page for various miscellaneous projects I've done that don't necessarily fit within a CS resume, including work from my Composing Digital Media class, which is what actually forced my hand to write this website, a task I'd long wanted to do and long procrastinated doing. And for more random insights into me, check out my extended About Me.</p>
