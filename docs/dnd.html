        <h2>Tomb of Annihilation</h2>
        <p>I DM'd a Tomb of Annihilation campaign for five good friends I met through previous D&D campaigns and have stuck with since. They explored Chult from August 2021 all the way through January 2023 and I kept session logs for every session.

            <summary>Session 1: The Party Assembles... Sans One</summary>
            <div>
                <!-- figure TBD -->
                <p>We start our adventure on the fine 2nd day of Kythorn, 1494. A lizardfolk postdoc, Dr. Wallace Woodward; a halfling professor, Dr. Evelyn (Evie) Brightwood; and a tabaxi fisherman, Hugo; have been sailing aboard the Silver Sailor on their way to Chult for about a week now. Led on the water by the gruff Captain Tyrol Quicksilver, our three heroes spend some time getting to know the flamboyant gnome Volo, as well as a half-orc priestess of Torm, Undril Silvertusk. A quiet figure of a Chultan man also lurks, standing more solitary.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, with a splashing sound, the passengers see a purple triton backpedaling towards the boat with a set of four drums. Helping him aboard, they learn his name is Motinui, and he begins to play some Hawaiian-sounding music to raise the spirits of the crew. With Dr. Woodward feeling hungry, Hugo offers to try to catch him some fish, but it is Motinui who is able to get the first bite. However, more bites would be coming soon, as the rest of the party noticed a pack of 5 plesiosauruses fighting over an octopus, 3 of which decided that the party looked tastier.</p>
                <p>Motinui jumped into the water and tried to communicate a sense of danger to the beasts. He successfully deterred one, but the other two were unfazed, and the closer of them took a huge bite out of Motinui, nearly swallowing him in one bite. They eventually repelled the beast, which fled after being badly injured. They were able to finish off the other one and hoist it aboard for its meat, but not before it got a good bite into Hugo, who had also jumped in to protect Motinui.</p>
                <p>The next morning, feeling somewhat rested, the party awoke to a stormier day. Off in the distance, they noticed a ship nearly silhouetted, but that seemed to glimmer just a bit. The ship began to gain on them, and it became clear they flew a black pirate flagâ€¦.</p>
            </div>

        <details class="session-log">
            <summary>Session 2: Aremag Would Like to Formally Welcome You to Chult</summary>
            <div>
        
                <p>3 Kythorn, continued: As the mysterious pirate ship gained on the Silver Sailor, the heroes began to think of ways to outpace the pirates. In a combination of standard ship work, inspiring performance, prayer to Umberlee, and a successful shot through the pirate's sail, the crew managed to steer themselves to clearer water and convince their adversaries they weren't worth the trouble. The Chultan man commended the party for their work and introduced himself as Rokah, suggesting that they seemed capable and he might have a job for them in the port. Captain Quicksilver informed the ship they should arrive the next day.</p>
                <p>4 Kythorn: After a dry and uneventful morning, as the ship grew closer and closer to Chult, out of nowhere Aremag the Dragon Turtle rose from the deep and DEMANDED TRIBUTE! Strapped for cash and with everyone but Rokah being caught unaware, Aremag grew impatient, slapping the ship with his tail, sending Hugo, Motinui, Captain Quicksilver, and much of the crew overboard into shark infested waters. All but one of the crew managed to clamber ashore, while those still on board looked suspiciously at Volo, who falsely claimed he didn't have much money with him. Motinui snatched his coin purse, and looking foolish, went to go get some more cash while Evie followed behind to ensure he didn't do anything stupid. While Volo went up with more gems, Evie also snagged a copy of Volo's Guide to Monsters. Finally appeased, Aremag slunk into the water.</p>

                <p>Finally, in the afternoon, the party arrived at Port Nyanzaru, witnessing the fragrant smells, beautiful people and art, and of course the dinosaurs. There they met Chiwa, a Chultan street urchin no older than 15 or 16 who offered himself as a city guide in exchange for food and lodgings. They arranged appointments to meet with Ekene-Afa and Wakanga O'tamu within a couple of days, and seeked out Rokah for more details on getting work. He told them he needed an escort to Fort Beluarian, and to create a distraction so he could tie the Flaming Fist to the pirates that had plagued them the day before. He also introduced them to River Mist and Flask of Wine, who suggested they gear up for travel. </p>
                <p>5 Kythorn: After a relaxing rest in Kaya's House of Repose, the party went for a bit of shopping and prepared to go to the dinosaur races later that day in an attempt to win some money.</p>

            <summary>Session 3: The Dinosaur Race</summary>
            <div>
        
                <p>5 Kythorn, continued: The party made their way to Tiryki Anchorage, where Motinui scanned the dinosaurs for a worthy ride. He quickly bonded with Nasty Boy, a young allosaurus, and chose him as his trusty steed for the race. After everyone placed some bets, the dinosaur races were off, pitting the newcomer Motinui against Ortimay Swift and Dark, Faroul and Gondolo, Salida, and the crowd favorite Tiryk. Despite an aggressive start slowing Nasty Boy due to exhaustion right out the gates, luck and skill conspired in Motinui's favor, and he managed to win the race, earning himself cash, an invitation to dine with a merchant prince of his choice, and the key to Port Nyanzaru. </p>

                </figure>
                <p>After the race, with his new earnings, Motinui struck a deal to purchase Nasty Boy from his trainer in exchange for a down payment and 25% of his future winnings. The whole party then went to the Thundering Lizard, where they celebrated with tej and greasy pub food. While there, Chiwa overheard a tall tale of a ghost town looking over the Aldani Basin. As the night partied on, suddenly horns and bells started ringing through the city. The party went to investigate and discovered the city was under attack by undead once again, and the Temple of Tymora was in danger. Offering to lend a helping hand, they found themselves face to face with a small horde of zombies and skeletons, led by an undead figure with an ominous blue triangle on its forehead.</p>

            <div>
                <p>5 Kythorn, continued: After a hard fought and rainy battle with the undead scourge, the party repelled them, killing their blue-triangle leader before they could break down the temple door. The priests and the city guard thanked them for their help and rewarded them with tej and a potion of healing. The blue triangle and the undead presence were still somewhat of a mystery. </p>
                <p>6 Kythorn: The party was up bright and early for their two meetings with Ekene-Afa and Wakanga O'tamu.

                <p>Ekene-Afa told them about the weaponry and gear she sells, including some (pricey) magic items. She also thanked them for their contributions to the city and for knocking her son Tiryk off his high horse (or dino). Motinui also shared some of his past and the negotiations he had with Ekene-Afa to unsuccessfully repel the Flaming Fist threat to his village.  </p>
                <p>Wakanga shared some of his knowledge regarding the undead, including the stories of the warlord Ras Nsi's attack on the now destroyed city of Mezro and the remnants of his undead army. He also spoke of an old town called M'bala on the Aldani Basin that Chiwa had heard of in rumors. Sensing that the party was not necessarily sure of where they were heading in the jungle, he asked them to go investigate the location of a wizard's missing shield construct named Vorn; he said the wizard's journal had been found around 15 years ago, due west of Camp Righteous.</p>
                <p>After their meetings, the party made final preparations for their excursion to Fort Beluarian. They hopped on a ferry, and had a couple hours of travel before they settled in for a peaceful first night.</p>

                    <img src="img/DND/ToA/Jungles of Chult.jpg" alt="A party looks out at waterfalls flowing into a ravine">
                </figure>
                <p>7 Kythorn: The party set out in the sticky jungle heat for proper this time, although their path along the coast was not the dense jungle one initially imagines but more of tall grasses, still fascinating in their biodiversity. In the morning's travel, Rokah noticed a tabaxi lurking in the trees watching them. When the party camped that night, the tabaxi approached sneakily, and gladly accepted an offering of fish. He introduced himself as Thunder in the Morning and warned the party of oncoming undead the way they were travelling, before skulking off into the shadows. </p>
                <p>That evening, on Motinui and Chiwa's watch, a pack of beautiful flying snakes circled the camp. They did not seem hostile, and Chiwa attempted to befriend them with some sort of trick involving a dead mouse heâ€¦ just sort of carries around?... But it didn't seem to work. Later, Hugo and River chatted as fellow tabaxis, and River mentioned a type of lobsterfolk called the Aldani that live in the Aldani basin - this prompted a philosophical discussion on the nature of cannibalism and the ethics of eating sentient beings. </p>
                <p>8 Kythorn: Near the end of the morning's travel, the party passed a beautiful little lake where brontosauruses were grazing on some type of root, including a baby brontosaurus that splashed the party playfully. Awwwww. Shortly afterwards though there was a horde 30 zombies strong, forcing the party to cut their way through thick vines to navigate around them. </p>
                <p>9 Kythorn: As the party neared the end of their travel, they came across a group of lizardfolk who had control of the path forward. They demanded a week's worth of food. Motinui managed to scare them down to 3 days, but negotiations fell apart after a bit of a shouting match. The party killed one of the warriors but the rest, including their shaman leader, escaped. But, the way was open for the party to move forward - after a good nights rest. </p>

            <summary>Session 6: Meet the Flaming Fist</summary>
            <div>
                <p>10 Kythorn: Waking up to a foggy morning, the party carefully continued on their way to Fort Beluarian when they heard footsteps and carts ahead. A Flaming Fist patrol was coming through, and seeing as the party couldn't get their charter of exploration yet, they were subjected to a patdown search, although Evie hid in the trees and wasn't noticed, and Chiwa was able to discreetly stash some belongings. In addition, Motinui, Dr. Woodward, and Rokah all gave fake names.</p>
                <p>In the afternoon, Dr. Woodward noticed a subtle path going into the thicker jungle. He and Evie went down it a bit, but vowed to come back later as they didn't want to go too far alone. The party had a quiet night, save for an odd encounter where Chiwa disturbed a horde of ants, and for a second thought he heard cackling laughterâ€¦ </p>
                <p>11 Kythorn: A stormy, windy day. It was a bit difficult to get food due to most game hiding from the storm. The party did come across a bloody fight between a pack of dimetrodons and pteranadons grounded by the wind, but decided to let nature run its course. In the evening, Rokah began to explain what he knew of the Fort and re-outlihed the mission - create a distraction for him to sneak in and find dirt on the commander, Liara Portyr. </p>
                <p>12 Kythorn: The party made it to Fort Beluarian shortly before noon, and began to explore the place. Their first task was purchasing a charter of exploration which was facilitated by the castellan and 2nd in command, Gruta Halsdottir. They also explored the fort to the regular tune of the bell signalling the changing of the watch, during which they schmoozed (Motinui posing as the high class Wake Scalebound) and learned of a jousting tournament happening tomorrow. </p>
                <p>Eventually, Hugo and Evie headed back to camp with Rokah, River, and Flask, when the rest of the party was summoned to the tough-as-nails Liara Portyr, who questioned them about their purpose in Chult. She also offered up a couple jobs - one to simply kill ghouls for 20gp/head, and the other to investigate some large footprints scouts found a couple days south of the Fort. Motinui, Chiwa, and Dr. Woodward got through the conversation surrendering some suspicious vibes, but without any major gaffes. From there, the party headed back to their camp outside the Fort to make final preparations for their plot tomorrow.</p>

            <div>
                <p>13 Kythorn: After finalizing their plan, the whole party returned to the Fort, not for the jousting tournament, but to talk to Liara Portyr with an invisible Rokah in tow. As Evie chatted up Liara for several minutes, Rokah silently snuck upstairs and swiped an iron strongbox from under Liara's bed. The party then made their way back out with the Flaming Fist essentially none the wiser. When they had escaped from the Fort, the party cracked open the box to find a stash of gold and a mysterious magical stone with a face on one side. Unsure of what it was, Rokah said he would try to get it magically analyzed back in the Port, and our adventurers started heading back to the Port. </p>
                <p>14 Kythorn: An uneventful day of travel. </p>
                <p>15 Kythorn: On their way back, the party stopped at that path Evie and Wallace had gone down earlier to investigate further. There they found a small abandoned village with signs of quick packing. They also found a couple clues: blood on a satchel with some left behind equipment, and a scrap of fabric that looked to be a Flaming Fist insignia. Without any bodies or people around, the mystery was largely left alone for now.</p>
                <p>That night, Rokah heard a message in his head: a gruff Chultan voice demanding an update. Wallace deduced this must be a Sending spell and realized that the stone from earlier must be a Sending Stone. However, it was not clear who was on the other line, and no response was given. </p>

                <p>19 Kythorn: In the night, the party finally made it back to the Port, which had a quiet, almost ominous vibe, with few people on the streets and boarded up buildings. Stopping a stranger moving quickly on his way, they learned that there was a huge tropical storm coming through tomorrow, hence the boarded up buildings, and that the city was a bit on edge due to a mysterious illness that has befallen Merchant Prince Jessamine for a few weeks now. The stranger believed that she had been poisoned by Jobal, and mentioned that similar illness was rumored to have come to high profile figures and adventurers worldwide. The party made their way to Kaya's House of Repose for the night, and puzzled over what to do next. </p>

            <div>
                <!-- storm or smth? -->
                <p>20 Kythorn: Being woken early by cacophonous thunder, the party experienced their first (not Chiwa's) tropical storm - thunder, sheets of rain, galeforce winds, the lot. They did brave the storm briefly to head to Goldenthrone to schedule an appointment with Wakanga, and they also headed to Rokah's place to check in. His contacts were not able to locate the sending stone's other half, so he handed it off to the party to see if they could convince Wakanga to help out. The party spent the rest of the day in Kaya's House of Repose, chatting with their old acquaintance Salida. </p>
                <p>21 Kythorn: A much clearer day (relatively). At the party's meeting with Wakanga, he offered a deal to locate the sending stone's counterpart as part of the reward for returning the shield guardian Vorn to him. When questioned about Jessamine's state, Wakanga unfortunately couldn't share much, as he was still learning about the Death Curse himself. He directed them to the Temple of Savras, where they met Grandfather Zitembe, the head priest. He performed a ritual for them to try to find the source of the Death Curse and saw a cryptic vision of a city to the south in Chult. </p>
                <p>The party relayed this to Wakanga, who entrusted them with a rare and valuable map of Chult - highly detailed, but mostly unfilled in the center. He also asked them to try to seek out this city and any evidence they might find. Planning out their route, the party decided they would keep River and Flask and head down the Soshenstar to reach Camps Righteous and Vengeance, the last location of Vorn's master, and the Aldani Basin and the mysterious city of M'bala on it. They stocked up on supplies and canoes and prepared to head out the next morning. </p>

            <div>
                <p>22 Kythorn: After a brief chat with Salida in the morning, who wished the party well on their journey, the party set out once again, this time into the jungle proper. Unfortunately, despite only being a few miles out of the Port, River and Flask's arguing combined with some plain old bad luck led the party to miss the head of the River Soshenstar and head down a wrong tributary. The party temporarily headed onto the shore to re-evaluate their position. </p>
                <p>While Evie and Wallace headed into the brush to review their map and orient themselves, they noticed 3 rather large bunny unicorn creatures, later identified as friendly almiraj. The party eventually started heading the right direction (south) once more, keeping a wide birth of a hungry looking turtle. </p>

                <p>The night passed rather uneventfully, except for a false alarm from Chiwa's rather alarming alarm spell. Flask also expressed his frustration with River's forceful persistence, and shared a rumor of an old woman in M'bala who could raise people from the dead in some sort of a merge of undead and humanity. </p>
                <p>23 Kythorn: After a foggy, but rather uneventful day of travel, the party settled down for an evening in an old ruin, identified by Evie as likely an old human residence area. However, in the dead of night, the party was beset by plant-infested, zombified, pale-white dwarves, as well as a pesky yellow flower with an alluring musk that seemed to control the zombies. Eventually dispatching the flower, the zombies became lifeless. The party effectively liquified the zombie corpses, and Motinui decided he would try to smoke the yellow musk creeper, getting fairly high and lightheaded.</p>

                <!-- camp righteous hopefully -->
                <p>24 Kythorn: Waking up to heavy wind, the party made the decision to wait until the afternoon to travel in hopes that the weather would get better. That gamble paid off, and they set off that afternoon, where they met a small band of Emerald Enclave scouts who had found a strange statue head that was talking. One of the scouts, Christine, brought the party to the statue, which introduced itself as Kukailimokukanaloalonokanehoalani, a name which appeared to be an amalgamation of many ancient tribal Chultan gods' names. When the party approached with caution and respect, praising its might, it allowed them one treasure from within it, and Motinui took a mysterious brass bottle. After that, the party continued on their way, unsure of what the statue was or how/why it came to be there.</p>
                <p>25 Kythorn: The party's travel down the Soshenstar continued. They had to briefly duck out of the river to avoid a patch of blue mad monkey mist, which was causing some crocodiles in the river to behave erratically. </p>
                <p>26 Kythorn: A fairly quiet day of travel. The main thing of note was a strange green blob that arced through the air way in the distance, but it was unclear what exactly it was. A mystery for another day perhaps.</p>
                <p>27 Kythorn: Today, the party was beset by the Flaming Fist once again. Fortunately, they did not seem to have gotten word that of the party's deeds in Fort Beluarian. However, there was nearly a problem, as River and Flask were not listed on the register of jungle guides. They managed to slip away with some clever deceit and with a thick pamphlet of paperwork to finish.</p>
                <p>28 Kythorn: At long last, the party came across the abandoned Camp Righteous. There stood the remnants of the Order of the Gauntlet's camp, as well as the imposing structure memorializing the tale of Man and Crocodile. While there, they released a fledgling axe beak, which Motinui tried unsuccessfully to befriend; scanned the old camp, finding only a forgotten holy symbol and a lone corpse rotting in a latrine; and searched through the beginning of the tunnel into the statue, triggering traps galore and badly injuring Wallace and Chiwa. They decided this mystery too would be for another day when they are stronger, and decided to continue on their way to the last known location of Vorn's master. </p>

            <div>
                <p>29 Kythorn: Continuing down the river for another day past Camp Righteous, the party fended off some hungry crocodiles in the fog before hiding their canoes in the jungle brush and setting out on foot into the jungle proper. That evening, as Chiwa and River kept watch, Chiwa noticed a crowd of grung had surrounded the camp in the trees and were pulling out daggers to throw. He woke the party up and a vicious battle ensued with Hugo taking some tough hits especially, but eventually the grung were all defeated, leaving no survivors to escape. The party settled back down for the evening to lick their wounds.</p>
                <p>30 Kythorn: With a bit of energy back after a grueling midnight fight, the party continued on their way to Vorn's last location. While setting up camp, Evie noticed some camouflaged figures wearing ant masks (later identified as goblins) watching them. The party called out to the stalking creatures, who slowly retreated into the jungle. Evie and Wallace tried to follow them, but couldnâ€™t find their tracks in the fog.</p>
                <p>1 Flamerule: That morning, Flask and some of the rest of the party noticed grung tracks headed the same direction they were, and sure enough, after several hours they came across a bit of a scene. They saw the inert statue of Vorn in the center of a clearing, being prayed to by some grung (apparently the same tribe that had ambushed them earlier) and some strange plant figures on plant dogs. Various offerings surrounded the statue, and a pair of masked goblins were walking off. Motinui spontaneously cast sleep on the goblins, knocking them out, and giving the party plenty of time to surround their sleeping forms while the grung and plant creatures watched in concern. The goblins, named Bog and Glog, promised they didn't know anything about the goblins who watched the party earlier, and were allowed to leave and go back home after revealing that the statue was very sacred (although they didn't have a name for it). The party investigated the scene for the control amulet, but found no sources of magic besides Vorn itself thus far, and they puzzled over where to go next.</p>

            <div>
                <p>1 Flamerule, continued: Still puzzling over where they could find the amulet, Wallace attempted to communicate with the grung before they left. The grung seemed to imply there was some sort of goblin civilization to the northeast and their grung settlement was to the south. However, the party decided to start heading northwest to try to get closer to the exact location that Vorn was marked on the map.</p>
                <p>That evening, the full moon rose, and the party was beset by a vicious wereboar! It came out the gates kicking, knocking Wallace unconscious just as he was standing up from waking up. The wereboar's unnaturally thick hide proved to be a serious obstacle, as the party's many nonmagical attacks proved futile, but eventually, the party's strength in numbers overtook the brute's raw strength, and they took down the wereboar as it tried to escape, which turned back into the Chultan woman she once was.</p>
                <p>2 Flamerule: A dry and windy day, the party made their way northwest, unfortunately not finding much along the way. There was a small elemental called a chwinga that tried to rifle through Chiwa's bags, but Wallace caught it with a quick grab, and when they released it, it disappeared after jumping onto a rock. The evening passed uneventfully, but the party seemed no closer to finding the amulet's location.</p>

                <!-- proper art of sewn sisters? -->
                <p>3 Flamerule: Awakening to a fairly rainy jungle morning, the party started heading to where they hoped the goblins would be when they found an unsettling sight: A tabaxi woman tied to a tree, covered in honey and crawling with ants, with a leather sack over her head and with two gold coins stuck to it as eyes. Freeing her, she introduced herself as Ringing Bells, an adventurer from the Company of the Yellow Banner who was separated during a T rex attack. She was then captured by goblins and tied up, supposedly for entertainment. She asked to move with the party for the rest of the day.</p>
                <p>In the evening, as Ringing Bells took watch with Evie, Evie started to zone out when she heard a muttering and fell soundly asleep.</p>
                <p>The five party members all awoke in a dream from their past: A young Evie at a dig site; Motinui by a coral reef outside his village; Hugo outside Daelin's shop by the sea; Wallace taking respite from his family in the library; and Chiwa by an underground river with the smell of blood and sibilant chanting in the distance, playing with the skull he uses. They all eventually noticed an archway in their dream, and entered it out of curiosity, or in Chiwa's case, out of necessity as the world started to crumble around him.</p>
                <p>The party then all arrived into a round entrance chamber, with stone walls that occasionally flickered with old memories and that extended up and faded into a starry, cloudy void. Three starry pathways, one red, blue, and yellow, headed into the unknown.</p>
                <p>Following the blue path, the party came into a square room with pedestals and alcoves, each with a leather bag on it. A mysterious face loomed from above, cackling. As the party began to open bags, finding only marbles, children's teeth, and poisonous gas, the woman watching from above began to stomp down with her peg leg. This continued for some time as the party puzzled over how to escape, getting nowhere. Eventually, Evie threw a bag of marbles at the woman in frustration, which didn't do much, but as she continued stomping, she slipped on the marbles and fell back leaving a ring of keys behind as a new pathway opened.</p>
                <p>Entering a new room with just yellow and red paths and 3 pedestals in it, the party went down the yellow path into a room with 2 large anthills and a skull on a shelf, as a disembodied voice began to taunt the party. As larger and larger ants began to pour out of the anthills, Hugo realized that there might be something else in the anthills. Sure enough, inside each anthill was a single gold coin. Placing those coins in the eye sockets of the skulls, the skull and shelf and ants all dissolved into slime, allowing passage back into the pedestal room.</p>
                <p>The final path after the red path lead to a room with 3 cages, each containing a squirming leather sack. A high pitched voice introduced them as her pets: a cockatrice, a large snake, and a fiery dog, all of which bursted out of the bags and the cages to attack! The cockatrice gave a bit of a petrification scare but was quickly dealt with, the snake was somehow befriended by Chiwa (and later brutally betrayed), and the dog dealt some serious damage before falling. As each died, they dissolved, leaving behind a feather, fang, and tooth respectively, and the passage back to the pedestal room opened again. Placing the children's teeth, gold coins, and animal parts on the pedestals, a fourth door opened onto a black path.</p>
                <p>Following the final path, the party landed in a large chamber with various supplies scattered on the tables, including a cryptic rhyme in another language and 5 pedestals with different metal locks. Eventually, each party member inserted a key into a lock, as the wall dissolved revealing 5 tables with restraints and a crucible of boiling metal over each. The party began to feel sleepy as 3 figures entered the room and led them each to a table: 1 with a peg leg and yellow gas coming from her mouth; 1 crawling with ants and with 2 gold coins for eyes; and 1 with a squirming sack over her head, out of which poked feathers, scales, and fur. As each member was strapped to a table, each head over a geometrically shaped mold, the crucibles were tilted as the party's vision went bright, then dark.</p>
                <p>4 Flamerule: The party awoke, unharmed (although River and Flask had been bound), with Ringing Bells nowhere to be seen. All 5 of the party had a small pinprick on their wrist, indicative of drawing blood or injecting something into the bloodstream. The party puzzled over the events that had transpired as the memories of their shared dreams began to fade.</p>

            <div>
                <p>4 Flamerule, continued: Moving on from the confusing events of the previous night, the party endured a day of foggy travel to the northeast. They realized they had likely gone too far north, and decided they would head due south the next day. The night passed uneventfully, although the dark fog encroaching on the camp creeped most of the party out, making them even a little suspicious of their mysterious companion Chiwa, who likes this sort of stuff.</p>
                <p>5 Flamerule: On an unseasonably nice day, the party began to head south to where they believed the goblin camp was. Shortly after setting out, they found a mysterious sonnet written in Primordial telling of an old city called Orolunga to the southeast in the Mistcliff Mountains. They decided to stay focused on the goblins and Vorn and stash the poem away for later, perhaps.</p>
                <p>A couple hours later, they began noticing signs of civilization - skulls on pikes, alarm tripwires, and a few scouts rustling away from them. Wallace tried to call out to them and convince them they were friendly, and they turned for a moment before continuing to retreat further south. The party, purposefully making their presence obvious to the goblins, came upon their camp - a small community of perhaps 40 goblins, young and old, with a few huts and some ant hills. Really of note though was that the whole village was essentially a trebuchet - the main village was set up on a thick net of leaves and moss, tied to a bent over tree and suspended with ropes such that when the ropes were cut, the tree would fling itself back up and the village would go flying. The goblins ordered the party to meet with their leader, Queen Grabstab, and Motinui served as the party spokesman, noticing a very familiar amulet on her neck - Vorn's control amulet.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>As Motinui attempted to parlay with Grabstab, who told them to pass on by and not disturb them, the rest of the party outside began to hear heavy thumping from the north, and it wasn't long before an enormous, fearsome tyrannosaurus rex emerged from the brush, ready to attack! Chaos ensued. The goblins began to run in all directions out of the village while Grabstab started to give orders in Goblin. In the thick of it, Motinui turned invisible and snatched the amulet off Grabstab's neck without her noticing, while the other party members jumped into trees, ran, and attempted to fight the tyrant of the jungle. Wallace came up with a brave plan to goad the t. rex into the net, then jump away at the last moment as the mechanism was released and the dino went flying with the village. This didn't go exactly as planned, as the t. rex ended up half on, half off the net, and Wallace was nearly made into a one bite snack, but Motinui's insults distracted the beast for one crucial moment. A couple of the goblins then attempted to cut the vines, but couldn't finish the job, so it was up to Chiwa to make the crucial decision to shoot at the vines with an Eldritch Blast, splitting the vines. It was anyone's guess as to whether the t. rex would be caught in the net, but by an extremely fortunate stroke of luck, the t. rex just barely lost balance, and soared through the sky to the southeast along with most of the goblin village. The party then absconded before the chaos wore off and Grabstab realized what she was missing.</p>
                <p>The party then decided to move slowly for a bit to ensure they were not being followed by the goblins and to cover their tracks. They did so fairly successfully, landing themselves in an unwelcoming marsh for the evening, where they decompressed for a bit.</p>
                <p>6 Flamerule: The party returned to Vorn's site, and Motinui, with Vorn's amulet around his neck, ordered Vorn to awaken, which he did! The plant-like creatures who were at the site seemed to take great offense, but Vorn and the party made quick work of both of the smaller figures and one of the plant-like dogs, the other one escaping. The party was then left with a brand new companion, and a taste of success.</p>

            <div>
                <p>6 Flamerule, continued: With Vorn in tow, the party traveled for about an hour more after pondering the value of their new friend - perhaps quite valuable. Vorn watched over them as they slept through a bit of a storm.</p>
                <p>7 Flamerule: A new day. The party decided they'd head back towards their canoes to try to head down to Camp Vengeance, although they later realized their new clunky friend would probably make canoeing impossible, as well as stealthing - the large robot proved not so subtle. In the afternoon, they found some delicious looking creatures known as zorbos that attacked when Wallace began to engage with them. A few scratches later, they were vanquished and eaten, and the party managed to avoid the lasting damage to their armor that zorbos are known to cause. They also picked up some wukka nuts, useful for light in a pinch.</p>
                <p>8 Flamerule: Early in the morning as the dawn rose and Wallace kept watch, two figures rushed through the trees into camp: one human, and one reptilian creature later recognized as a saurial, a very rare alien creature vaguely related to a dinosaur. The human, Artus Cimber, urged the party to hide, citing the presence of Red Wizards of Thay, while the saurial, Dragonbait, gave off various strange scents in lieu of speech. After hiding for about 20 minutes safely, the two parties conversed a bit. Artus mentioned that he was being sought after by various groups but was notably cagey as to why, claiming "it's better that you don't know." He did provide a bit more information as to the undead's source - Ras Nsi's undead army against Mezro - but didn't know much about the Death Curse. He then said he was searching for Orolunga to get some unspecified knowledge, and thanked the party for sharing the poem they had found a few days earlier with him. Then, they went off.</p>

                <p>The rest of the day passed fairly uneventfully, although in the evening Wallace made the troubling discovery of thick hair starting to grow under his scales.</p>
                <p>9 Flamerule: The party arrived at Camp Vengeance past noon, and it seemed to not be in the best shape. Sick troops, moldy tents, festering pools, and decaying carcasses were everywhere, as the Order of the Gauntlet seemingly struggled to keep things going deep in the jungle. The party earned the good grace of one of the camp's captains, Perne Salhana, and the head priest of the camp, Sister Cyas, as well as reunited with their old shipmate Undril Silvertusk. They provided much magical assistance to the camp by curing some of the diseases the camp's men had come down with. Meanwhile, Undril diagnosed Wallace with what he had worried he might have - lycanthropy - after he felt uncomfortable holding a silver coin. Hugo tried to convince the priests to spend some time removing Wallace's curse, but they seemed hesitant to divert any power away from keeping the most ill alive. The party thought about the best way to help out the camp and also get some of what they were looking for - namely, a curse removed and perhaps a bit of cash for all their efforts too.</p>

                <!-- undead siege pic, or girallon/zombie clot split-->
                <p>9 Flamerule, continued: The party, deciding to help the beleaguered forces of Camp Vengeance, all set out to work on various tasks - repairing the tents, clearing the ditch of corpses and refuse, and tending to the wounded. However, trouble was approaching, as foreshadowed by a sense of the undead in the jungle that Evie felt and a stressed conversation Wallace picked up parts of from the command tent. Soon, the commander Niles Breakbone emerged and gathered up the camp to warn them of a big undead attack numbering in the hundreds to arrive by nightfall. Ordering the party not to go running off, he told everyone to prepare themselves.</p>
                <p>As nightfall approached, the camp readied themselves, with everyone on duty. The party's ranged attackers positioned themselves on the watchtowers with the camp's forces, and a defensive perimeter inside the walls readied themselves to hold off intruders. Soon, with the half moon overhead, the undead began to shamble out - clusters of zombies, ghouls, and ghasts encroaching upon the camp. At first, things seemed to be under control - the zombies were generally easy to stop and although the ghouls and ghasts were resilient, the walls seemed to keep them at bay.</p>
                <p>However, only a short time after, the second wave arrived - more zombies, and the hulking forms of ogre zombies, huge ankylosaur zombies, and terrifying 4-armed primate zombies approached. The primates were shockingly fast, and worse, could climb the walls, allowing them to come in and make quick work of the camp's foot soldiers with their flurries of blows. They were eventually dispatched (not without serious casualties), but the rest of the forces came ever closer.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the first sections of the walls finally gave way, and the forces on the ground tried desperately to keep the undead at bay. However, just as the ankylosaur zombies reached the walls, a demoralizing 3rd and final wave approached - zombies, some of which looked diseased; some pale figures with troubling ranged attacks; and 2 hulking monstrosities that looked to be amalgams of corpses combined into one entity. However, the 3rd attack was barely necessary - the ankylosaurs made short work of the walls, and the camp was about to be overrun. Wallace and many others urged Commander Breakbone to call for retreat as the rest of the party started their escape early (lead by Hugo), but he adamantly refused. Soon though, the chaos was too great, and with Breakbone's bones broken by an ankylosaur tail sweep, the gate was opened, and everyone ran for their lives. While the party escaped mostly unscathed, the loss for the Order of the Gauntlet was severe. Only fifteen of nearly sixty people survived, with Perne and Undril the ranking officers amongst them. Both groups stumbled away from a devastating defeat wondering what on earth they could do nowâ€¦.</p>

            <div>
                <p>9 Flamerule, continued: Reeling from their defeat, the party decided to run through the night to get as much distance as possible on the undead. Although questions ran through their mind - what caused the undead to do this, chief among them - there was no time to think, as they ran north while the sun rose.</p>
                <p>10 Flamerule: Exhausted, the party managed to settle down for a full 24 hours to recover.</p>
                <p>11-15 Flamerule: The party continued to travel back up the Soshenstar en route to Port Nyanzaru, racing the moon to get there before Wallace transformed at Midsummer's full moon. Their first setback was an unfortunate foggy misdirection, causing them to go south instead of northeast and effectively losing them 2 days. However, they got back on track and waved to Camp Righteous, still not ready to try their hands at conquering the shrine.</p>
                <p>16 Flamerule: CRACK! BOOM! A torrent of rain and gusts awoke the party to another tropical storm. Thoroughly soaked and with no proper shelter in sight, the party hunkered down and generally were miserable. </p>
                <p>In the night, as Chiwa and Wallace peered through the darkness and the rain for potential danger, it found them: 4 yuan-ti, 3 purebloods and 1 malison, emerged from behind them. The purebloods all attempted to convince Wallace to go back to sleep with their magical silver tongues, but he resisted their efforts and screamed to wake everyone else. However, all hell broke loose when Chiwa himself tried to magically stand Wallace down and hear what the intruders had to say.</p>
                <p>Chaos ensued. Wallace aimed his slingshot at Chiwa, who was held onto by Vorn on Motinui's command. Evie tried to stand between Chiwa and Wallace to break them up, while Hugo's divinely glowing hammer was pointed at Wallace. A few shots were fired at the yuan-ti, who retreated and spoke to Chiwa under the name Sehauxan, asking him to speak with them when he was less preoccupied. Chiwa admitted he recognized the leader, the malison Shoztessah, from his past and that his name with them had been Sehuaxan. He told them he had taken the skull he used to channel his magic from them. However, he largely squirmed around other direct answers. The party lowered from their Mexican standoff, with most of the party (Wallace in particular) frustratedly going back to bed in the miserable storm. However, Evie went with Chiwa to keep him safe while Chiwa had a private conversation via message with Shoztessah. Evie asked directly the question on everyone's mind - are you a yuan-ti? - and while Chiwa again didn't fully answer, Evie knew he was still hiding something important. Everyone went to bed, as part of a more fractured, confused party. Who exactly was this orphan kid from the streets of Port Nyanzaru?</p>

                <p>23 Flamerule: Another day of travel, but as they waded along in the river on their canoes they saw the unwelcome sight of a posse of Flaming Fist blocking the river ahead. Immediately hiding Vorn with invisibility to prevent the Flaming Fist from seeing and presumably seizing him, the party eventually was hailed over. Unfortunately for them, word of their deeds at Fort Beluarian had finally made their way through the ranks, and they were placed under arrest for a litany of charges. But, the party would not go down without a fight - as the chief officer attempted to read them their rights, it was clear that they would not go peacefully and combat began. </p>

                <!--TBD figure-->
                <p>23 Flamerule, continued: Combat broke out between the party and the Flaming Fist as had seemed destined, but the party's superior might and reflexes proved an easy victory. After killing all the commanding officers and chasing down a couple of fleeing soldiers to prevent word of their crime from spreading, only one Fist remained, tied up in his canoe. Through all this, Motinui started acting strangely sadistic, even gruesomely cutting off the face of one of the soldiers and wearing it as a crude mask to intimidate their prisoner. They attempted to interrogate the soldier, named Private Corporal, but due to his rank he didnâ€™t seem to know much of use - they had better luck combing through the Sergeant's papers, finding the details of the crimes they were charged with and some more information on the mysterious bootprints south of Fort Beluarian. Motinui agreed to allow their prisoner to leave in exchange for total silence on what had happened that day, and the soldier seemed very willing to cooperate, but Chiwa ensured that he would by killing him with a virulent spell before he could be released. The party then fled from the grisly scene.</p>
                <p>24-29 Flamerule: The party continued on their way back to the Port, discussing amongst themselves the other members of their party and questioning what came next. Wallace approached Chiwa, making a working relationship but assuring that any harm he caused the party would result in death. Motinui suggested to Hugo that they kill River and Flask so as not to have to split the reward from Vorn, a suggestion that Hugo refuted and then informed the rest of the party about (sans River and Flask themselves). The moon grew ever fuller.</p>
                <p>30 Flamerule: Finally arriving in the Port amid mist and rain, the party discussed what their first order of business was, deciding that the best choice was to head to Wakanga first for the reward, then go get Wallace cured. However, they had to take a quick diversion to find Motinui, who had slipped away while they were discussing and had headed to the dinosaur pens to pick up Nasty Boy. He would find himself short on cash anyway, so the party headed to Goldenthrone. Wakanga then took them to his personal villa, where in exchange for the amulet, Wakanga provided 3500 gold, split 7 ways, and a discount on his wares. He also pointed out the location of the other sending stone on the map as a point on the shore of Jahaka Bay. Hearing the news of Camp Vengeance's fall, he returned to Goldenthrone to work and the party was escorted out.</p>
                <p>While Motinui headed off on his own to purchase Nasty Boy in full and hype up his return to the dinosaur races for Midsummer, the rest of the party toured the many temples of the Port in search of a cleric with remove curse available. There were none, but Priest Zarolo of Tymora agreed to prepare it for first thing next morning at a discount for having helped his temple earlier. The party however did get a chance to visit all the temples and see their preparations for Midsummer - the Temple of Tymora was rehearsing a play, the Temple of Gond was preparing carnival games, and the Temple of Sune cleaned them up from their disgusting jungle travels (except Chiwa, who refused) - and meet or reconnect with Savras's Grandfather Zitembe and Mother Sibonseni of the Hall of Gold. They also shared the solemn news of Camp Vengeance with the assorted clergy. Exhausted from over a month in the jungle, they returned to Kaya's House of Repose to rest, where Evie received a long-awaited letter back from home.</p>

            <div>
                <p>30 Flamerule, continued: While Motinui returned to Kaya's to rejoin the party, his night was not over yet. Having ordered Vorn to kill Wakanga just before handing over the control amulet, Motinui was out for blood and hoped to assist or at least observe Vorn in the assassination. Around an hour before midnight, Motinui slipped out of his room and went outside. Having last seen Wakanga headed to Goldenthrone to work, Motinui snuck over to find a way in. Still shrouded by fog and with the added protection of invisibility, Motinui scanned the building, finding 8 guards total, with the main and service entries both guarded by 2 of them. Able to divert one of the guards at the main doors with a mysterious call for help, he successfully snuck behind the other, but was thwarted by a locked door. He then tried to snatch the keys off of the remaining guard's belt, but the sound of the door rattling alerted her that something was amiss, and Motinui was not fast enough to grab it. As the guard called for backup, he ran to the service door, where one of the guards had just left to help at the main gates. Unfortunately, in his rush, his footsteps were heard, removing any chance of grabbing his keys. Seeing no other option besides attacking, he pulled out his crossbow and got a solid shot on the guard, but he was tough and muscled through it. Motinui then pretended the shot was an accident, but the lie was not particularly believable and this guard also called for backup, engaging Motinui in combat. Although Motinui had the first move, the guard's raw athleticism and training dominated Motinui, and even with a hellish rebuke the guard stood strong and cut down Motinui with prowess. Motinui's vision went dark as he passed out.</p>

            <div>
                <!--TBD figure... trippin?-->
                <p>Midsummer 1494: Only an hour or two past midnight on Midsummer morning, the party was rudely awakened by the city guard pounding on their doors. Not sure of what was going on but not seeing Motinui among them, the party make a reasonable deduction that he had gotten himself into trouble and agreed (without much other option) to come in for questioning. Each of them was questioned 1 by 1 under a zone of truth, but they managed to avoid telling the guards the worst of Motinui's outbreaks. Eventually let go, the party returned to bed, dreading what news they'd hear the next morning.</p>
                <p>They awoke for the morning a few hours later and rushed to the Temple of Tymora where Wallace's curse was ended not a day too soon, and as they returned they heard the news from the town crier: Motinui had been arrested after trying to break into Goldenthrone and assaulting a guard. The trial was that day and, assuming a guilty verdict, Executioner's Run the next day. The party discussed what to do, eventually deciding to allow the trial to go on as normal but potentially trying to aid Motinui in the Run the next day. They enjoyed the Midsummer festivities - the Merchant Prince dunk tank, the carnival games, and the feasts.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Motinui's trial was in session. The guard who he had attacked testified against him, seemingly damning his case. However, something very interesting happened: under oath of zone of truth, Motinui testified that he couldn't remember large swaths of the past week or so, including the night of the attack. Perplexed by the magical truthfulness of his statements, the judges left Motinui with a choice: plead guilty and face the Run, or plead not guilty by reason of insanity. Motinui chose to plead what he, in his confused and psychologically split mental state, believed to be true - not guilty. </p>
                <p>The rest of the party, hearing this news, headed to Fort Nyanzaru to say their goodbyes to Motinui, who was due to be sent off to rehab at the Temple of Sune for the foreseeable future. As they left, they noticed a large gnoll who had just won the unchained dinosaur race of the day. They later went to the Thundering Lizard to drink, where he introduced himself as Trippin when they met again. Following that, they headed back to Kaya's for the night, re-meeting Salida there as well.</p>

            <summary>Session 20: Party Reconstitution</summary>
            <div>
                <p>1-2 Eleasias: With their party now guideless and down an adventurer, and low on resources, it was time for the party to recover truly from the jungle and the fallout shortly after. Each member going on their way to pick up their personal supplies, they later reconvened to find new party members.</p>
                <p>First was the guide. With River and Flask likely not willing to return to the party, said party headed to the docks, where various guides had posted advertisements on a board near the harbormaster's office. Browsing the blurbs of Azaka, Eku, Faroul/Gondolo, Hew Hackinstone, Musharib, and their recurring pal Salida, they instead decided to chat with Eku, enticed by her righteous words. Speaking with her in her home, she saw right through their caginess about their intentions at Jahaka bay, but eventually agreed to come with them once they admitted their purpose. However, in exchange, she asked the party to help extinguish the life of a hag named Nanny Pu'pu residing in M'bala - a great evil, in her eyes.</p>
                <p>Next was their 5th party member. Not entirely knowing who to go to other than the burly looking gnoll Trippin they had met earlier, they approached him in the Thundering Lizard. Chiwa cut to the chase and explained their plans, to which Trippin laughed (as he seemed to do at just about every statement) and agreed to join them, seemingly looking for adventure. They still didn't know much about him, but he seemed genuine, and despite the grim sense of humor, not a lunatic - a marked improvement.</p>
                <p>Finally was a bonus party member: as the party exited the inn to head back toâ€¦ the other innâ€¦ they were approached by a young half-elven woman named Xandala with a pseudodragon named Summerwise who pleaded to go into the jungle with them. Promising that she could handle herself with her magic and help pay for any fees, she explained her purpose: to find her father, Artus Cimber. The party agreed to take her along, and planned to leave the Port the next day.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>3-8 Eleasias: With the party assembled, they made their final preparations and purchases and headed once more on canoe down the Soshenstar. The first few days went fairly quietly due to their familiarity with this early stretch of river, and a fortunate lack of disturbances on the way.</p>
                <p>9 Eleasias: On the 9th, the party arrived once again at Camp Righteous, where the party decided it was time for another go at uncovering the secrets of the House of Man and Crocodile. Still unsure of what triggered the pit and axe traps, they circumvented them with a casting of spider climb on Wallace. He crawled up the walls and seemed to make significant progress, uncovering a puzzle floor and a matching pattern on a wooden door above it. However, when he interacted with the pattern on the door, he was blasted away and fell haphazardly onto the puzzle floor, subsequently being blasted with flames. The traps had bested them again, and Wallace et al. scurried away. Eku, who wasn't pleased they were disturbing the shrine in the first place, urged them to keep moving towards Mbala. Xandala seemed not interested in the scenario altogether.</p>
                <p>10 Eleasias: Continuing down the river, the party was approaching Camp Vengeance when they heard cries of help coming from the riverbank. Three women were hailing them, a broken canoe beside them, asking for food and support. Sensing a trap, Hugo used his Divine Sense to try to see if these women were who they say they were. They didn't light up, but a different woman did - Eku, apparently a celestial.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, the three women were in fact hags, and their human forms melted away into hideous, slimy visages. Although they looked fearsome at first, once one went down and the coven was broken, the other two scattered. Eventually chased down by Wallace, Evie, and Trippin, the hags were slain. Eku thanked them while lambasting Chiwa, Hugo, and Xandala for not chasing after. In the resulting heat, Chiwa revealed Eku's celestial nature, which she did not deny, but didn't provide details (nor was she pressed for them). The party grabbed the hags' treasure (a vial of poison and some non-magical art items) stored in their bait canoe and continued on down the river.</p>

            <summary>Session 22: Mbala</summary>
            <div>
                <p>11-14 Eleasias: The party continued on their way to Mbala. They first passed by Camp Vengeance, which eerily had a coordinated undead presence, with zombified ogres and skeletons seeming to stand guard. Steering clear having not nearly enough presence to challenge the camp, the party stowed their canoes shortly after, as they would have to travel along the edge of the Aldani Basin on foot. As they trudged on the edge of the swamp, they escaped most trouble, although they did have the opportunity to gaze upon the multicolored glean of a flail snail that had traveled close to the basin. However, their real challenge laid ahead of them: the daunting cliffs of Mbala.</p>
                <p>15 Eleasias: As the party arrived at the base of Mbala and began to prepare for the hike up the  narrow stone stairs, they learned some unfortunate news: Eku had seemingly been prevented from entering Mbala by a powerful ward surrounding the cliffs, presumably placed there by Nanny Pu'pu herself. Pressing onwards without her, and vowing to return with the deed done, the party and Xandala began to climb, hiking high, high up above the tree line. This offered a pristine vantage point of the surrounding jungle, and the party noticed a few points of interest: A mote of floating earth far in the Aldani Basin, a ziggurat to the west among the Mistcliff Mountains (Orolunga), and what seemed to be a crashed ship in the trees to the south, somehow.</p>
                <p>However, in Mbala, there was only death - piles of skulls and abandoned buildings. The one unabandoned building was a small hut, where an old, old woman came out of. Before she really had a chance to say anything, Wallace immediately fired, not wanting to hear a word out of her mouth. Although she was wiley, using invisibility, passing through walls, and utilizing her flesh golem and psychic primate minions as defense, Hugo's detect evil and good was the key to keeping her on the radar, and she couldn't escape in time before she was picked down by the might of Trippin and the arcane prowess of Chiwa, while Xandala, Evie, and Wallace held off her minions. Bruised, but victorious, the party sensed they had grown stronger together, more ready to take on the next great danger, wherever that may be.</p>

            <div>
                <p>15 Eleasias, continued: With the evil hag Nanny Pu'pu conquered, the party located her treasure (some gems, a scroll, and adamantine ingots bearing the Dwarven runes "Hrakhamar") and returned to Eku who had set up camp for the evening. She smiled seeing the hag's head in Wallace's hands, and thanked our party for vanquishing this great evil. Having seen Orolunga from atop Mbala, the party agreed to head there next, accepting a short detour from their main goal of Jahaka Bay.</p>
                <p>16-29 Eleasias: The party wound their way back to their canoes near Camp Vengeance before trudging through the Aldani Basin and the River Tath towards Orolunga. About halfway through this journey, they came across the bizarre sight of a frigid cold wintery sphere on the river, with rain freezing as it entered the radius and full animals frozen within. Lost as to what could cause it, the group continued on their way.</p>
                <p>30 Eleasias: On their final day of travel, the party wandered through some old ruins, where they were ambushed by two kamadans â€“ huge leopards with poisonous snakes growing on their heads. Although Chiwa in particular took a beating, they were quickly dispatched. However, when they heard faint mewing, they realized that there were two young kamadans without any snakes (or perhaps just normal leopards, adopted?) that they had orphaned, and they picked them up to protect them from the dangers of the jungle.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/DND/ToA/Kamadan.jpg" alt="A leopard-like creature with several snakes protruding from its neck">
                    <figcaption><p class="figsubtitle">A Kamadan</p></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Eventually, the party arrived at Orolunga, finding a 3 story ziggurat with an enclosed shrine at the top â€“ but no sign of Artus Cimber. The first set of stairs was covered in impassable, sharp thorns, but they watched as a chwinga was able to waltz through unharmed when carrying a purple and orange orchid. The party found a patch of these orchids and mimicked its behavior. The second stairs were crumbling, and the only way through was to mimic a second chwinga, walking as lightly as the parrot feather it carried. The last set of stairs was crawling with snakes. The party was horrified to see a third chwinga calm one of the snakes and have it slither into its mouth, allowing it to slither up the steps. Evie attempted to follow suit, but physically recoiled as the snake snuck close, her mind somewhat scarred. Hugo, however, was able to do so successfully.</p>
                <p>As Hugo reached the top, none other than Artus Cimber and Dragonbait emerged from the shrine. The party introduced Xandala. However, as Artus said "I don't have any ch--", Xandala quickly cast a spell, commanding in a malicious voice: "Give me the ring." A chaotic battle ensued, as Artus, charmed, tossed a frost-coated ring to Xandala, who began to fly away at incredible speed, although not before Trippin launched a huge attack into her. A jungle chase ensued. Artus pointed his dagger at her, teleporting onto her and grappling her to the ground. However, her frequent use of misty step, shield, and incredible speed made her hard to catch. Eku then revealed her true form â€“ that of a winged serpent, a couatl â€“ and daggered after Xandala, keeping on her tail. It seemed as though Xandala was going to escape with the ring as she flew above the treeline, but at the last moment, Percy climbed a tree with Evie on his back, allowing her to make a long distance shot, dropping Xandala hard on the jungle floor, where Eku dove in for the kill.</p>
                <p>Artus quickly grabbed the ring from her corpse, and profusely thanked the party for helping stop her, realizing that they must have been duped. He explained he was the guardian of the ring, a powerful artifact that needed to not fall into evil hands. He explained the wintery scene on the river had been his doing. However, he seemed reluctant to travel with the party, having his own goals and not wanting to bring attention to the ring with the added party presence, nor to endanger the party further. He encouraged the party to meet with Saja N'baza and bid them farewell once again. The party climbed the steps of Orolunga once again, where the snakes parted ways for them, and they entered the shrine.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="img/DND/ToA/Ring of Winter.jpg" alt="A golden ring covered in blue frost">

                </figure>
                <p>???: The party emerged in a mystical, golden shrine, filled with aromas of incense, cushions, and birds, and the wise Saja N'baza slinked over to them. She thanked them for defeating the great evil she sensed from the shrine, and asked them what they seeked in this place. She had only vaguely heard of the death curse, but when informed, she provided omens pointing to the lost city of Omu, informing them that Ras Nsi, the warlord, yet lived, having cheated death, and that he planned to end the world from Omu. She also hinted that the Flaming Fist had a wide network of allegiances, and although she did not concern herself too deeply with this sort of mortal matter, thought that the party might be able to cut a strand of their web, if not solve the problem entirely. Before the party left, the wise naga bestowed upon each of the party members a charm to aid them in their quest â€“ in exchange for their promise to vanquish Ras Nsi.</p>
                <p>1 Eleint: The party emerged from the shrine, and although the sun was setting when they went in, it was now rising. The party descended the steps, and blue tulips bloomed around them.</p>

            <div>
                <p>1-14 Eleint: With new knowledge in hand, the party continued on their way to Jahaka Bay, reassured their suspicions of piracy would be founded by Saja N'baza's guidance. As they headed down the River Tath back from Orolunga, they passed through the gorgeous Ataaz Kahakla and its many-colored fossils and lifeforms. They also managed to avoid a bout of mad monkey mist that seemed to have infested the mind of an erratic brontosaurus, climbing along the edge of the gorge with an elaborate rope system. They continued into the bay, where they left their canoes and finished the journey on foot, and also spotted the red dragon Tzindelor (or Tinder) flying south over the Kobold Mountains.</p>
                <p>15 Eleint: As the party encroached close to the point on their map on foot, stealth mode activated - Evie's pass without trace and Chiwa's invisibility allowed the party to get right up unseen, where they found an anchorage, complete with pirate guards, a ship riding at anchor, and a second ship docked - the same glittering vessel that had attacked them months ago. In addition, in a cage across the water, they saw the unmistakable gnomish form of Volo himself, in a sticky situation. Wallace attempted to swim across the water to free him, but attracted trouble when a band of sharks attacked him. As the pirates began to suspect something was amiss, the party began to infiltrate, disguised as a pirate (Chiwa), invisible (Hugo and Trippin), whatever worked. By the time the alarm bell was rung, the whole party was effectively inside, and the assault began.</p>
                <p>Over the course of a couple minutes, the party heroically mowed down dozens of pirates, despite all odds seeming against them. Although they were seriously outnumbered, the party's magic, tactics, and brute strength outlasted the waves of pirates, despite the ship at anchor providing supporting fire with ballistae and poorly aimed crossbow shots. Seeing that hope was lost, the fancily dressed captain of the ship at dock escaped, although just barely, by quickly rowing a cutter out to the second ship, where he was helped aboard. However, although the captain did escape, the party had successfully captured the Anchorage, and plenty of prisoners.</p>

            <div>
                <p>15 Eleint, continued: With the pirates successfully vanquished, the party began to search for incriminating evidence, as well as to free Volo. Attempting to get closer to Volo's cage, Trippin and Wallace headed to the warehouse in an attempt to find a passage through, but did not find any. Then, Wallace made a fatal mistake: he touched one of the boxes of cargo.</p>
                <p>Immediately, 10 swords stuck into the wall animated and began to attack the two intruders, both still badly wounded from the battle. With things looking grim, Wallace jumped out the window into the bay to escape the slashing swords and beckoned for Trippin to follow, but in the moment before he could follow, the swords attacking Wallace moved to Trippin, and cut him down unconscious. With the rest of the party still running up to the upper levels, there was nothing anyone could doâ€¦.</p>
                <p>TRIPPIN IS DEAD.</p>
                <p>Although the blades were eventually beaten down, it was too late to save Trippin, who had already bled out. The party grimly reconvened to say their goodbyes, and gave their gnoll friend a warrior's funeral, setting a pyre on a boat and allowing it to drift out to sea. Although the death stung deeply, the party did find some important evidence - a ship's ledger on the Emerald Eye - as well as a fair amount of gold and items. The party also attempted to interrogate one of the pirates, who called himself Old Man Lanthar, but he was clearly far too drunk to give any useful information - they would try again later.</p>
                <p>That night, as the party watched over their prisoners and intermittently bonked them back to sleep, they saw a striking-looking myconid that approached, sneezed spores on them, and loudly, telepathically introduced himself as Flump, an ancient myconid with very little social grace. The party, tired and grieving, did not really want to deal with this, and asked him to come back later. He returned the next day, passed the party's admission interview, and was allowed to stay.</p>
                <p>16 Eleint: In addition, in the morning, the party was able to successfully interrogate the pirates, including Lanthar (sans 'Old Man') and his sorry bunch, as well as the old tavern proprietor Bosco Daggerhand. From them, they got the confession that they truly were working with the Flaming Fist, although Bosco was the only one who seemed to know the full truth; the rank and file seemed to only vaguely know of the deal. Nonetheless, the party knew they had good, if not 100% definitive, evidence to clear their names.</p>

            <div>
                <p>16 Eleint: With not much left to do in Jahaka Anchorage, the party gave one last look over the Anchorage (making sure to grab a bit of loot from Bosco's chambers) and then set out. Although it was a bit of tight quarters to steer out of the cave and through the submerged rocks serving as defense, Hugo put his sailing skills to use and led the crew, a mix of adventures, pirates, and one Volothamp Geddarm, onto the open sea, leaving only superficial damage to the Emerald Eye. However, not everyone was along for the ride - Bosco jumped overboard, attempting to swim to shore. His death at the party's hand was inevitable, but in his words, it was not a pirate's way to go. Bosco was killed, his body retrieved and decapitated in case there was any bounty on him. Following this, Eku let the party know that she was a friend of the harbormaster Zindar, and would inform him of their impending arrival in his dreams that night.</p>
                <p>17-27 Eleint: After a peaceful travel back to the Port other than a distinctly non-peaceful extortion by Aremag once again, the party came into Port with a makeshift white flag raised. Zindar, the harbormaster and a golden half-dragon, flew over to inspect the ship, but aided by his acquaintance with Eku, allowed them in without much trouble. They would, of course have to be questioned as usual. However, they were rewarded with a sack of gold for the bounty on the ship, and allowed to go on their way. They crashed at Kaya's House of Repose, as usual.</p>

                <p>28 Eleint: The party was woken in the morning by a messenger calling them to testify to Goldenthrone that afternoon. Thus, after some brief free time in the morning, they headed to Goldenthrone to testify in front of the Merchant Princes - one of whom was Mother Sibonseni, standing in for Jessamine. Although they got off to a bad start when Flump tried to walk up and plant spores on the MPs, he left (having no real information on the Flaming Fist anyway) and the party spilled the beans. The MPs, seemingly perturbed by the fact that their story was verified by the zone of truth, granted the party asylum from the Flaming Fist and sent them out so that they could deliberate. The party then headed to the Thundering Lizard, where Flump, unable to become intoxicated, beat a dwarf at a drinking contest, and the rest of the party opened up to each other over a drinking game.</p>

            <div>
                <p>29 Eleint â€“ 20 Marpenoth: Following their return from the jungle and having been granted asylum by the Merchant Princes as friends of the city, the party made the decision to spend a few weeks in the city training, learning, and preparing for their biggest expedition yet.</p>
                <p>Hugo capitalized on the time to get his maul enchanted by the ever-busy Wakanga O'Tamu. He also discovered an underground community of Umberlee worshippers, with whom he strengthened his connection to his god. Wallace hired a personal trainer to help him maintain a high intensity training regimen, boosting his athleticism for when it would undoubtedly be needed later. Flump, on the other hand, hired a life coach to help integrate him into society and explain social interaction, with an emphasis on understanding people's emotions and reading for lies.</p>
                <p>Evie and Chiwa, on the other hand, headed the party's research endeavours, using a small collection at the Temple of Savras, gathering info from townsfolk, and occasional forays into private collections of the MPs to attempt to understand Ras Nsi, Omu, and more. The location of Omu was highly sought after, but the most promising lead was a map that had been torn out of a book, leaving them with little more knowledge than they had already, although they felt sure it was near the Peaks of Flame. They also learned some of the history of Omu and its fall.</p>
                <p>Another hot topic was the mysterious Ras Nsi. They learned a brief history of Mezro, and his exile and subsequent war against the city. They attempted to figure out what happened to the fallen bara following his failed war, but only found vague references to the south. The party also briefly researched yuan-ti, with Evie even trying to look up Chiwa's mysterious skull to no avail.</p>
                <p>However, one dramatic event did occur amidst this downtime: On 13 Marpenoth, the church bells rung out: Jessamine has died. A strange mood fell upon the city as the first ever change of a Merchant Prince occurred in the city's history (the MPs being a relatively recent change to government structure), with Mother Sibonseni formally taking Jessamine's place. Although the party knew they couldn't have saved her given how long it would have taken them to trek south in Chult, the stakes of the Death Curse were clearly laid bare.</p>

            <summary>Session 28: Exploring the Ruins of Mezro... Or Are They?</summary>
            <div>
                <p>21 â€“ 28 Marpenoth: Refreshed and equipped with better weapons and new knowledge, the party and Eku headed back out into the jungle for perhaps the final time. Now seasoned jungle veterans, the party began canoeing down the River Tiryki, before crossing through a narrow part of the undead-infested jungle towards Port Castigliar. Although the undead did not actually prove much trouble for a large party of experienced adventurers, it was clear that the jungle there was less healthy than usual.</p>
                <p>29 Marpenoth: Finally arriving at the beach of Port Castigliar, the party found a long-abandoned settlement mostly washed away by the sands. This was not much of a surprise, as they knew the settlement was taken by the undead long ago. What was a surprise was the visitors â€“ on the shore, an enormous longboat with sails seemingly made of white dragon wings was anchored. From far away, Wallace spotted a skeleton crew of an unusual species: Frost Giants! Two of the huge, blue figures waited on the shore while another 2 kept watch on the ship. The party, not wanting to be noticed, kept their distance, and after an hour retreated further into the jungle to rest.</p>
                <p>30 Marpenoth - 1 Uktar: Upon waking up, the frost giant ship was still docked at the beach, and one of the guards appeared to be a different giant than the first crew. Not knowing how many more frost giants could be below deck, and assuming they weren't leaving anytime soon, the party decided to give the giants a wide berth and go around them to get to Mezro.</p>
                <p>As they headed to Mezro, Wallace was first to hear heavy footsteps from ahead. The party ducked for the cover of the overgrowth as a band of 3 frost giants and 2 winter wolves passed by, muttering in Giant as they passed. It was then that Hugo made a connection: Frost Giants... Ring of Winter... could they be after Artus? It seemed reasonable enough, although there was no proof. The party headed on their way once more.</p>
                <p>2 Uktar: After avoiding making a giant mess (obligatory pun requirement fulfilled) the party finally arrived at the ruins of Mezro. There they saw 4 quarters of a city, all flooded and overgrown, with an opulent temple at the center and a shantytown on the outskirts. However, the whole area was swampy and buggier than usual, and worse, an unsettling aura surrounded the ruins, like a storm about to break.</p>
                <p>Deciding to head towards civilization first, the party canoed through the swamp towards the shantytown, before spotting Flaming Fist insignias on docked ships and immediately turning around. They instead decided to move into one of the quarters of the city. There they found an old statue dedicated to King Osaw I, but more interestingly, noticed people, not obviously Flaming Fist but not all Chultan either, watching them from across a stream. Approaching peacefully, they were welcomed by a dwarf named Emberon Coalscuttle, who shared with them visions he had received from "the mudmaw", a type of tentacled crocodile nobody has heard of ever giving people visions. These visions included prophecies of a godling infant, the death curse, "The Forsaken One" (whatever that might be) and others. However, getting uncomfortable vibes, the party moved along, not wanting to know what this mudmaw was or why these cultists really worshipped it.</p>
                <p>As they attempted to cross the canal to another district, they unfortunately made a bit of a splash as Hugo snapped a vine and fell into the water (nonobligatory pun requirement fulfilled). This drew over a Flaming Fist patrol from near the temple, who demanded to see paperwork, which the party wanted no part of. Initial attempts by Wallace to intimidate the patrol failed and they were shot on, but further words of warning from Eku and Chiwa (and one of the guards faces being eldritch blasted off, although that admittedly wasn't the goal) was enough to convince a retreat.</p>
                <p>The party continued onwards toward an old library, which had also been ransacked mostly. While there, Chiwa detected an aura of wild magic permeating the air. They then headed into a back room where a mage named Ilyazni was poised to attack the intruding party, but the situation was defused and they began to talk to the mad mage about her research, spread across the walls like a conspiracy board. She suspected that the ruins of Mezro were not as they seemed, and that what they stood in was some sort of fake or illusion. She hinted that the Temple of Ubtao in the center of the ruins would explain why.</p>

            <summary>Session 29: Into the Temple of Ubtao</summary>
            <div>
                <p>2 Uktar, continued: With their work in the library done, the party began to head to the opulent Temple of Ubtao. As they approached, the temple always seemed to be facing them at the same angle - perfect symmetry, or some sort of illusion? Perhaps both. As they entered the grand double doors, they came into a hallway filled with statues. Noticing King Osaw I's statue in the hall, they surmised these were statues of the barae, but they did not see any that were defaced or corresponded to Ras Nsi. At the other end of the hallway was a magically darkened hallway.</p>
                <p>This hallway proved to be quite the confusion, as it led various people to completely different rooms within the abandoned temple, including an old library, an apothecary, a prayer dome, and most intriguingly, a throne room. This throne room, covered in labyrinthian patterns like the entire temple, seemed to have a layout of the city of Mezro on the ground, with miniscule people walking about the city. It didn't seem to correspond to the ruins as they knew them; could this be the real Mezro? There was no way to tell. Wallace was the first to figure out the secret of the archway, which was that the destination could be controlled by thinking about where to go.</p>
                <p>After a short rest in the old kitchen, the party emerged into the original hall, where their old friends the Flaming Fist were waiting! Strongly requesting the party come to their camp, Camp Promise, to parlay with Commander Brokenbarrel, the party seemed unlikely to cooperate, but Flump agreed to be a "neutral" arbiter (his neutrality being somewhat questionable in this scenario). He went alone to Promise, and after a quick grilling by Brokenbarrel, a gruff goliath woman, was able to set up a neutral location for a peace meeting. And, although the peace meeting was generally rather acrimonious, it went surprisingly well. With nearly 60 of their people there, the Flaming Fist didn't want to get into a fight and lose many of them, but the party was not looking to get themselves killed. So, in exchange for a bit of information, the party was allowed to simply leave Mezro rather than face the Flaming Fist's wrath.</p>

            <div>
                <p>3 - 7 Uktar: Heading away from the mysterious ruins of Mezro, the party headed down the River Olung as they made their way south to search for Omu. Along the way, they passed through the Laughing Gorge, Ataaz Muhahah, where the shrieks of monkeys would echo through the gorge before transforming into unsettling laughter. Chiwa flew up above the monkeys hanging from the vines on the underside of the bridge to investigate a large statue on the bridge, which appeared to be some sort of shrine to Ubtao, judging from the labyrinthian patterns. Chiwa paid his respects by tracing the maze with his finger, to no effect. He also saw a shattered skeleton to the side of the statue, but couldn't deduce how it got that way. The party simply decided to move along, not wanting to disturb anything.</p>
                <p>8 Uktar: After a few days on the lazy river, the party came across a lush, long-abandoned garden, filled with stone sculptures and overgrown with plants, some of which psychedelic and hallucinatory. Carefully moving through the garden, called Nangalore, the Garden of Lost Dreams, they uncovered bits of messages in a language that Chiwa felt was familiar, but couldn't comprehend even magically. However, they were able to start piecing together translations using shards of some sort of Rosetta Stone.</p>
                <p>There were a couple of unsettling signs in the garden. In a pool at the rear of the garden, the bottom of the pool was lined with incredibly lifelike figurines of fish, lizards, and small birds. In addition, in a central palace, there was a realistic statue of a man. He reached for an urn beneath a larger statue's legs with a look of terror on his face. Suspecting petrification effects may be present, the party moved carefully. They were also constantly shadowed by cranes known as Eblis, generally a malevolent species.</p>
                <p>They also stumbled across Queen ZalkorÃ©, who introduced herself as the Queen of Omu. She wore a beautiful feather dress and veil, and addressed the party calmly, yet confusingly - she seemed to believe a black orchid near her was her lover and a respected general, Thiru-taya. The party was respectful and learned some information (that she was Queen, but exiled in a coup), but left her presence quickly.</p>

            <summary>Session 31: Regicide (but in a good way)</summary>
            <div>
                <p>8 Uktar, continued: The party continued searching around the abandoned garden, uncovering more and more messages scrawled on the walls. Now getting the hang of it and with a fully recovered Rosetta Stone, they were able to use the circular translation tool to decipher the writings. It appeared that Thiru-taya had at some point betrayed ZalkorÃ©, who the garden had been built for, and that she also was hallucinating on the plants in her gardens.</p>
                <p>The party returned to the Queen's presence to say their farewells and in an attempt to gain more information, but she (and Thiru-taya, apparently) was displeased at the death of the jaculis and yellow musk flower the party had killed earlier. She asked for a repayment - specifically, for Chiwa as a slave. The party was understandably less than thrilled about this arrangement, and Flump attempted to convince the mad queen for another arrangement, but she grew frustrated when the party did not have anything valuable or beautiful enough to keep her interest. In a last ditch effort, Evie handed her the eversmoking bottle. As she opened it to see what was inside, the smoke poured out and chaos ensued as ZalkorÃ© shrieked and called for their deaths.</p>
                <p>A hectic battle filled with smoke in the eyes of most everyone involved occurred, preventing the medusa's gaze from catching any of their eyes - save for Wallace, who was surprised by her magically emerging from the pool at the rear of the garden and only barely resisted petrification. However, even with the eblis casting spells and aiding her, ZalkorÃ© was beaten down. Even calling out for Thiru-taya to protect her was not enough, as Chiwa delivering powerful necrotic magic using inflict wounds through his familiar sealed her fate, although the familiar was struck down by Thiru-taya's spectral spear. In the end, Wallace sunk the last stab down into the medusa's snake head, and she was slain.</p>

            <div>
                <p>8 Uktar, continued: With the final blow dealt to ZalkorÃ©, all that was left to do was clean up. The party searched for any last messages and stone fragments and took the minimal amount of loot remaining in the Queen's chambers - mainly, small vials of tincture that were likely derived from the hallucinogens in the gardens. They then returned to the central building, placing the black orchid by Thiru-taya's ashes in a symbolic gesture. There was one thing left to do though: Eku wished to restore the petrified man next to the statue. With the party's blessing and Flump's arms wrapped around him, Eku reached out and reversed the curse on the unlucky soul.</p>
                <p>The man quickly wriggled his way out of Flump's arms and after a moment of disorientation, introduced himself as Gowl, a Chultan treasure hunter. He had been petrified for at least 30 years. With no real life left for him back at the Port, no real way to get there anyway, and a burning curiosity that was unpetrified with him, he asked to join along with the party as they headed towards Omu - where he was originally headed those years ago.</p>
                <p>9 - 17 Uktar: Steadily trekking through the most infested portions of the jungle, the party came across the Heart of Ubtao, floating about 200 feet up and slowly spinning while red liquid (likely water filtered through iron deposits) dripped down. Not seeing an obvious way up, Chiwa flew up with enough rope for an entire sailing ship. Noticing a cavern heading inside the earthmote, Chiwa peeked in and found an elven woman, who had converted the place into a study. She seemed surprised to have visitors, but invited the rest of the party up with an arcane gate.</p>
                <p>Introducing herself as Valindra Shadowmantle, she discussed what she knew of the Death Curse. She believed it to be caused by an artifact called the Soulmonger housed somewhere in Omu, and that it was designed to capture souls. She was glad the party was seeking a solution, but strongly urged them not to destroy the Soulmonger unless necessary, for fear of unleashing the immense necromantic energy inside. She instead suggested they locate it and seize it so it can be first quarantined and studied. The party was largely suspicious of her, and for good measure, Hugo felt out with his Divine Sense. To his dismay, Valindra showed up as undead.</p>
                <p>Although Valindra offered an explanation relating to exposure to those infected with the Death Curse (who would light up as undead as well), the party remained skeptical. As friendly as possible, they asked her to let her associates on the ground know they were coming, and headed off the rock.</p>
                <p>18 - 27 Uktar: The party headed their way over the shipwreck they had seen so long ago from Mbala. Unfortunately, there was not much of worth in the wreckage of what appeared to be a Halruaan airship, and the crew had starved to death long ago. They left the desiccated corpses alone.</p>

            <div>
                <p>28 - 30 Uktar: From the wreckage of the airship, the party headed further south towards where they believed Omu to be. Along the way, they met a curious group of large alligator folk on a hunting party. Although there was a bit of tension (and many of the party successfully stayed hidden in the grass), it was dispersed as their leader, Jedediah "Jed" Green, introduced himself. He and his group were down south in the undead-infested jungle searching for a zombie T. rex they were hunting. Having no information on this and largely not trusting the random people they met on the side of the road, the party wished them luck and went on their way.</p>
                <p>The Feast of the Moon 1494: As the party continued through the deep undead jungle, the fog around them grew thick, and commotion began. Simultaneously, the group began hearing the moans of zombies and a familiar female voice yelling for help. Battle began with the party fending off skeletons and infected, plague-spreading zombies. In the midst of the battle, the voice calling for help burst onto the scene - it was Salida, all the way from Port Nyanzaru! The party seemed suspicious of her presence, but there were bigger fish to fry - namely, the zombie T. rex chasing after her. After a long and arduous battle, with Hugo being downed and Flump ending up the T. rex's jaws, enough arrows, stones, and eldritch blasts went into the beast to crumple it down, with no casualties sustained.</p>
                <p>Of course, the next question was: why was Salida here, and what should they do with her? She explained that she was with a group she was guiding that came from the south of Chult up, who were eventually eaten by the beast they had just killed. Although there were no obvious tells in her story, the party's general skepticism combined with a concern that she seems to keep following them around led them to keep her at arm's length still. Allowing her to stay with her for the night at least, Salida attempted to talk to Flump, but he firmly rejected any interaction with her.</p>
                <p>1 Nightal: In the morning, the question remained. Flump made it very clear that he did not trust Salida or want her in the party, which she had requested to join over attempting to make her way back to the Port alone. The party's permanent members (i.e., not Gowl) had a good long discussion about what to do with her. Chiwa, who had talked privately with her before, also had suspicions that Salida could be yuan-ti - although his attempts to communicate in a yuan-ti specific manner failed, and he did not have proof. Chiwa also took this moment to formally reveal himself as yuan-ti, a fact that the party had known for a while, but an important step in honesty regardless.</p>
                <p>Although the didn't trust Salida, was it better to keep her close where they could watch over her? The decision, unanimously decided (Eku abstaining), was "no" - she should not join the party. The decision was also "no" to whether they should kill her (Eku not abstaining). So, the party returned to Salida, presented their ruling, and told her to be on her way. Salida said she understood and left, alone, but unharmed.</p>

            <div>
                <p>1 - 4 Nightal, continued: Having ejected Salida, the party headed south towards their guess of where Omu might be. As they headed through the deep undead jungle, they began to notice fragments of roads and cobbles from structures long buried by the overgrowth. Going further south, the signs of civilization increased and the undead abated, replaced by everpresent snakes, which seemed to follow them as they traveled.</p>
                <p>5 Nightal: Eventually, the party came across a small river headed the way they wished to continue, and following it, they came across a wondrous sight. The river flowed into a waterfall, crashing down into a huge basin, where a beautiful city stood proud. However, each party member (except, strangely, for Eku and Gowl) saw something unsettling. The details varied, but in each the city was under siege, and the visions all ended with a sphere of darkness enveloping the city, and them. Their experiences converged as they looked upon the city as it truly was: overgrown and destroyed.</p>
                <p>Seeing no way down from the waterfall, the party headed around the rim of the basin, noticing gargoyle statues perched every hundred feet or so on the perimeter. Thanks to Wallace's sense of curiosity, the party was able to discern that these were living gargoyle statues, and ceased poking at them before they got themselves killed. Heading around to a stair entrance, the party began to explore the old city of Omu.</p>
                <p>First coming across an old guardhouse filled with ominous graffiti, the party ventured into the city. Noticing a grung tied up and being danced around by the fungus creatures they had seen at Vorn (identified as vegepygmies, or moldies), Flump intervened. Combat ensued, and though the grung was nearly shoved into the enormous pit of lava in the city, Percy hauled him from the edge and rescued him. Telepathically introducing himself as Imbok, he promised the party great riches if they followed him to his father, the tribe leader.</p>
                <p>Following their grateful guide, the party found themselves at the rushing river, flowing into the lava pit. Seeking a way over, the party found a tall, downed tree spanning the river. Hugo was the first to head over, but it was a trap - halfway across, he was shot in the neck from across the river. As he fell unconscious, Hugo twisted himself to fall onto the tree and not into the river, and combat ensued. However, with the element of surprise gone, the shooter was overwhelmed, and surrendered. Giving up his weapons, the tabaxi introduced himself as Bag of Nails, and offered the party stew for a battle well fought. However, his friendly gesture did not seem to be well met by the party following the assassination attempt, and the only thing stewing was a pot of tension.</p>

                <p>5 Nightal, continued: Bag of Nails attempted to wriggle his way out of a sketchy social encounter, trying to explain his concept of a hunter's death, and speaking of the legendary beast, the King of Feathers. But, the party was having none of it, and as he attempted to bolt, he was struck down by Hugo and the gang. In his lair, they found 5 small vials of a black substance.</p>
                <p>From there, they continued on their way to follow Imbok to his father, a gold grung named G'lorb G'lorb. G'lorb G'lorb explained that Imbok was his 180th son, and he was very displeased that he got captured, thanking the party for returning him such that he may kill him himself. As a reward, he allowed the party into the shrine of Nangnang, the great grung goddess. Filled with treasures unimaginable, it was a sight to behold, but they were all illusory. Learning of the tale of Nangnang and Shagambi the kamadan and attempting to decipher the clues of the shrine, they struggled, but eventually opened the inner doors and claimed a 3-inch puzzle cube. However, its purpose was unclear.</p>
                <p>Exiting the shrine, looking for more like it, they came to the shrine of Obo'laka, the zorbo. Her tale was of her and I'jin the almiraj. Following a water portal to the shrine room, they noticed a petrified Red Wizard with his hand on the cube. Disarming the shrine's defenses, they were able to grab the cube. When Eku learned of the petrified wizard, she suggested they restore him to get more information and potentially make begrudging allies with the Red Wizards. This, however, did not occur, as the negotiations were testy and the mood bitter. Refusing to give much information, Voj, the Red Wizard, left after a muddled mix of diplomacy and intimidation failed to convince him. As the party (newly christened as Adventurers Anonymous) left the shrine, a zorbo, burned to death, lay near the entrance.</p>

            <div>
                <p>5 Nightal, continued - emerging from Obo'laka's shrine, and tired from a full day of adventuring, the party headed back near Bag of Nails' hideout to attempt to rest. They briefly peeked at the shrine to the north, but suspected it was already looted - they'd wait until later to verify though. They settled down, as Chiwa started to cast a tiny hut.</p>
                <p>However, he would not finish, as the party sensed movement from beyond their house, and an ambush had been laid! The yuan-ti, with Shoztessah and Salida among them, had formed a full assault team. Although they had lost the element of surprise, they had numbers, and the party was surrounded. As the yuan-ti battered and bruised the party, nearly killing and then dragging Gowl away, Chiwa climbed to the roof and asked the yuan-ti what they wanted. The answer was him. Agreeing to go with them if they let Gowl and the rest of the party go, Chiwa climbed down the building and was escorted toward the abandoned temple. The party, left shell-shocked, resolved to rescue Chiwa if he didn't rescue himself, but knew they couldn't do anything in the state they were in, and so rested, wary of danger.</p>
                <p>6 Nightal: Awaking the next morning down a party member, the party decided to do a bit of scouting before forming a plan to save Chiwa. Evie formed a magical bond with Percy, reformed as a pterodactyl, who flew about the city, gathering information. He found the locations of a jaculi shrine on the pillar above the lava and an eblis shrine to the north in the river. More vitally for the recon operation, he was able to find 2 entrances to the yuan-ti lair - a well-worn tunnel, which some Chultans appeared to be carting treasure down, and a secret entrance in the bush that some purebloods and malisons were using. Where both headed was unclear. He also noticed near the amphitheatre a flash of color and heavy stomping, but when he went to investigate, nothing was there.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, other party members investigated the shrine of Unkh the flail snail, which in fact had already been looted. There were three ghouls, emblazoned with triangles, burned to death across the floor, and the pedestal was barren. Leaving it alone for now, the party regrouped, when they noticed a few kobolds enter the shrine, clean out the corpses, and leave. When the party returned, the keys necessary to solve the puzzle had been replaced. Hugo, in stubborn determination, solved the puzzle by aligning the puzzle keys and finding the matching key in the old building outside (but not before making a wrong turn, causing the flail snail statue in the room to light up and blast him and Wallace with a ray of light). However, it was in vain, as the puzzle cube was not replenished.</p>

            <div>
                <p>5 Nightal, the previous evening: Chiwa, having surrendered, was taken alone by the yuan-ti raiding party to the temple complex, down a well-worn and muddy path to a set of bronze doors. The gates opened, and Chiwa was escorted by Shoztessah into the temple - The Fane of the Night Serpent - Chiwa's home, from before Chiwa was Chiwa. Quickly brought into the presence of Fenthaza, the Fane's resident nightmare speaker, Chiwa was questioned: what exactly did he seek? Claiming he sought immortality, Fenthaza offered an alternative - the bliss of the void upon Dendar's return and subsequent destruction of the world. This was truly not what Chiwa wished, but using his yuan-ti guile, he convinced Fenthaza that he indeed shared that goal. Fenthaza then shared that Chiwa was to be turned into a malison - something Chiwa had truly wanted not too long ago - tomorrow evening, hinting that his powers would be needed to help summon Dendar. She hinted that Ras Nsi had grown weak and might not possess the strength to carry out that vision - and warned Chiwa to stay out of his sight.</p>
                <p>Ras Nsiâ€¦ Chiwa's memories had been returning, bit by bit, as he re-entered and explored his home. Ras Nsiâ€¦ the ruler of the Fane.</p>
                <p>Granted free reign by Fenthaza, Chiwa scouted out his home, rediscovering (among other rooms) the ritual cathedral, the religious murals, the storerooms, the yuan-ti nests (he always slept in the far corner), the blood bathsâ€¦ it was strange to be back home. He had a night of fitful rest, greeted once again by the ominous figure he had dreamt of the night before. When he awoke, he bided his timeâ€¦ plotting his escape.</p>

            <div>
                <p>6 Nightal, continued: With Chiwa somewhere within the temple complex, Adventurers Anonymous decided it was time to get more information. It was time for Wallace to shine, as his attunement with his druidic side had picked up once again, allowing him to transform into various creatures. Over the course of a few hours, he infiltrated the Fane a few times gaining information on the layout and defenses of the fortified temple. The whole place was swarming with yuan-ti - brute force looked to be, well, brutal - but as a spider, Wallace evaded notice and was able to explore much of the compound, finding the slave quarters, the hydra(!) lurking in the underground river, as well as the ritual cathedral. He also had a scary run-in with a giant talking snake in the storeroom, who saw the spider as a treat and nearly chomped him, which would have blown his cover.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Wallace was able to find Chiwa, although he couldn't speak to him. Chiwa, perplexed by a spider acting weirdly, eventually surmised that it was sent by AA, and relayed the information he knew to the spider, who eventually relayed it back to the party when he returned. In the meantime, the party had a new visitor - it was Dragonbait! Although it was hard to discern what he meant through his smells, the party eventually deciphered that Artus had been captured - along with the Ring of Winter.</p>
                <p>The party used what magic they had available to them - namely, Eku's scrying - to peer in on Artus, imprisoned in a pit, but looking alright given the circumstances. But, he did not wear the Ring, and Dragonbait eventually managed to convey that no magic would be able to find it. With the stakes high as ever, the party planned their intricate plot to save the prisoners.</p>

            <div>
                <p>6 Nightal, continued: With night approaching, it was time for action. The party, under the stealthy embrace of a pass without trace, snuck close to the main entrance. Wallace, bringing an extra weapon and a copy of the plan, wild shaped once again and snuck in, delivering the items to Chiwa. When he arrived, Chiwa was finishing a conversation with Fenthaza, who said the ritual preparations were about to begin. When Chiwa was given the materials, quickly reading the plan, he headed across the room and using his spectral gaze to look through the walls saw Artus being hoisted out of his prison cell by Fenthaza and her guards. Chiwa rushed over (with Wallace on shoulder) and saw that Artus was being tied to the sacrificial altar. Fenthaza, sensing something amiss, forced the issue on Chiwa, ordering him to begin torturing Artus, but as the dagger came down, he cast dimension door and ran.</p>
                <p>Chaos ensued as Artus and Chiwa ran to the rest of the party and they fled to Bag of Nails' home with the yuan-ti chasing after. (Meanwhile, the yuan-ti at the southern entrance were distracted by Percy flying around with fireworks strapped to him.) As the party safely absconded, Wallace stayed back for just a moment to get a glimpse of something he wanted to see - the throne room. He crawled through the door and beheld, coiled on the throne, Ras Nsi. He was bandaged and rotting, but most importantly of all, wore the Ring of Winter.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Wallace escaped as well, and regrouped with the party, who left Omu for the time being. In the relative safety of the jungle, Artus apologized for the mess he had gotten them into, and explained his motivation to see Alisanda again and the tales of Mezro and its false destruction. Having heard from Saja N'baza that Mezro would not return until Ras Nsi was gone, he recklessly attempted to strike him out. The party and their many companions rested the night and pondered what to do now with both the Red Wizards and Ras Nsi after them.</p>

            <div>
                <p>7 Nightal: After a well-deserved rest, the party decided that, with the path unclear, they would head back into the city to try to get a handle on what the deal with the shrines was, and to potentially find a way to turn the Red Wizards and the yuan-ti against each other. When they arrived back at the city entrance, they were greeted with a sight - a message in blood, warning that the yuan-ti would kill prisoners each day until they surrendered. The yuan-ti weren't the only ones after the party though - the Red Wizards had sent some bodyguards to demand the puzzle cubes that they had gathered. Refusing this request and trying to talk their way out of it, they were jumped by two Red Wizards who had hid themselves invisibly on high ground. However, the ambush was largely unsuccessful, as the ambushers were severely outnumbered and the force of Adventurers Anonymous overwhelmed them. However, one of the two wizards narrowly escaped Evie's pursuit, disappearing into the brush. Meanwhile, the other had been defeated, and although Wallace initially tried to stabilize the wizard, Hugo convinced him that there was nothing to gain from him, and bashed his skull in.</p>
                <p>Following the ambush, the party interrogated the corpse of one of the mercenaries using speak with dead, gaining some intel about the Wizards. After that, the party proceeded to the kamadan shrine, but seeing it likely already raided, they exited, and proceeded to take a short rest to recover from the battle. But, with prisoners dying every day, they knew that vanquishing Ras Nsi was a necessity - and urgent.</p>

            <div>
                <p>7 Nightal, continued: With the urgency of the situation apparent, it was time to take action. Deciding between two main options - sneak in the back and past the hydra, or use disguises to create a fake prisoner scenario - AA took the former, more direct route. Relying once again on Evie's pass without trace, the full party crept up to the Fane's secret entrance, where the three malisons lurked, watching the entrance but not finding the hidden party. As they snuck up, the party unleashed a deadly ambush, and although one of the yuan-ti survived the initial assault, she was not able to act in time to ruin the plan before being struck down.</p>
                <p>The party crept down into the tunnel, where a similar scenario faced them - this time, four broodguards. Using Chiwa's hypnotic pattern to immediately incapacitate two, the rest of the party chopped down the other two as silently as possible, before slitting the throats of the hypnotized guards.</p>
                <p>Next was the hydra. Hoping to satiate it, Hugo and Evie piled the four broodguard corpses, plus one of the malisons dragged down from the entrance, into the two rowboats at the bank of the underground river. Quietly sailing out, they spotted the hydra lurking beneath the water. It seemed to be sleeping - but Evie knew well enough that one head was likely alert. Dumping the five corpses - one for each head - into the water, the hydra viciously snapped them up and sunk beneath the surface again. Not wanting to risk another second of being caught, the boats sailed back and picked up the rest of the party. As they carefully sailed past the appeased hydra, light poured out ahead from the throne room, and Adventurers Anonymous prepared themselves. It was time to confront Ras Nsi.</p>

            <div>
                <p>7 Nightal, continued: Arriving at the shore, the entrace to the throne room, Adventurers Anonymous, joined as usual by Eku, as well as Gowl, Artus, and Dragonbait, gazed upon their enemy. Ras Nsi, the ancient warlord turned malison, coiled on a hydra throne, in a state of disgusting decay and wrapped bandages. On his finger was the Ring of Winter, and his forehead held the blue triangle. By his side stood broodguards, malisons, and his right hand man, Sekelok. As the party arrived, Artus jumped out and exchanged vicious words with Ras Nsi, getting everyone's blood boiling. Hugo and Evie, meanwhile, attempted to converse with Ras Nsi, explaining their purpose of stopping the death curse. Ras Nsi did not seem to know what it was. It seemed as though perhaps Ras Nsi was not the cause of the death curse, and for a moment that diplomacy would be possible. But with Artus in tow, there was no chance of peace. Ras Nsi's eyes glowed ice blue, his longsword cloaked itself in flame, and ghouls emerged from behind his throne. Battle had begun.</p>
                <p>At first, things didn't seem to be going so poorly. The party got in a few strikes on Ras Nsi, although he blocked a few more with a casting of shield. However, when he got the chance to act, disaster struck. Pointing with the Ring of Winter, a frigid globe of energy struck the surface of the water, exploding and washing nearly the whole party in freezing winds. As the water froze over, immobilizing the boats in it, Gowl was frozen in place for a moment of hesitation, and was struck with the full force of the spell, freezing him to death in an instant. He stood like a statue, just as the party first found him.</p>
                <p>There was no time to mourn, as Ras Nsi slithered over the teleporter in the room and disappeared. Although Flump still knew where he was due to the wreath of Warden's Fire that he had slung on him, it was unclear how to get to the room north of the throne room where he hid. The party tried in vain to activate the teleporters, while more and more yuan-ti from within the complex poured into the room - an endless force of damage. Eventually, Chiwa figured out the trick to the teleporters, getting the knack of it and finding his way into Ras Nsi's opulent chamber, where the villain unleased a flurry of flaming swings on him. Chiwa saw the back side of the secret door into the chamber and teleported himself back out, but it was a bit too late, as the rest of the party was severely swarmed in the throne room. Retreat was all but forced, but not all was lost. </p>
                <p>A few strands happened simultaneously. In the throne room, Eku (in her true form) and Flump held off the yuan-ti's attacks allowing most of the rest of the party to escape by swimming out  the river, the hydra fortunately satiated from before. Meanwhile, Chiwa used the teleporters to appear in the prison, and used his guile to convince the yuan-ti that the prisoners had to be transferred. He then dimension doored over to the slaves in the grotto, disguised himself as another yuan-ti from the complex, and convinced the selfish slavemaster to save himself, leaving the slaves unattended. Chiwa then forced the slaves out to escape, although the slaves in the prison pits did not manage to make their way to the exit before being stopped by Fenthaza. And, all the while, Wallace hid as a spider in a crack in the wall, allowing the end of combat to blow over, preparing to survey the aftermath.</p>
                <p>In the end, it was a bloody, bloody stalemate. Although the party was badly hurt, and Gowl lost for good, slivers of hope remained. Several yuan-ti were slain, perhaps weakening their defenses for another go. 13 innocent slaves were rescued. And Wallace remained as a spy on the inside. But, Ras Nsi had escaped death once again.</p>

                <p>7 Nightal, continued: Following the brutal combat, while the rest of the party fled with the dozen or so prisoners they had rescued, Wallace stayed back to view the aftermath of the battle in the Fane. While he couldn't speak Abyssal to understand the yuan-ti's speech, he was able to spy on some general themes.</p>
                <p>The major one was wrath: Following the battle, Ras Nsi spoke viciously to Fenthaza, who argued back, only to be broken up by a 3rd yuan-ti. He was later identified as Yahru, the spymaster. Beyond that though, Ras Nsi's anger grew violent, as he brought the cowardly slavemaster Chiwa had tricked before him, and turned him into an ice statue, ending his life as punishment. Beyond this, the rest of the yuan-ti recovered on their own, while the corpses from the battle â€“ including Gowl's â€“ were brought through the secret door to Ras Nsi's chambers to an uncertain fate.</p>
                <p>Wallace retreated back to Bag of Nails' house, where the others had stopped to rest for a moment. But, the situation was not sustainable â€“ what would happen to the 13 freed people, most of them not suited for combat? Knowing that they would certainly not make it back to the Port in one piece on their own, Eku suggested that she would arrange a pickup on the southern coast back to the Port, but Flump volunteered instead to bring them to safety. It was another sad goodbye, but at least Flump was alive and doing good.</p>
                <p>Following this, not wanting to stay in the same place too long, the party moved to another building on the west side of the city, where they settled down for a much-needed rest. As they slept, Evie and Hugo spotted those flashes of color they had spotted before coming from the north, and heard gunshots, but nothing came to disturb them.</p>
                <p>8 Nightal: Following a long, long day, the party began to prepare themselves for the next day, when they were immediately beset by danger! Coming out of nowhere, a colossal tyrannosaurus with enormous colorful feathers seemed to, for lack of a better word, teleport out of the brush. Roaring at the party instilling fear in even the bravest of the party, the King of Feathers attacked, inflicting vicious wounds and moving erratically. Snapping up Evie in its mouth and trying to run off with her as the dinosaur was badly injured, a familiar face came out of the jungle to fire the final blow â€“ It was Jeb! The gator had been hunting big game, and with the rest of his crew not willing to enter Omu, he went alone.</p>
                <p>As the party harvested some trophies and meat from the largest dinosaur, they knew that they couldn't stay, as the enormous corpse would surely attract attention. So, they moved to a nearby abandoned campsite, where they found a scrap of parchment from a member of the Company of the Yellow Banner. It mentioned, among other things, some sort of artifact named the Eye of Zaltec, as well as a Tomb of the Nine Gods. This tomb seemed important, perhaps named after the trickster gods, and the party knew there was a Tomb from some of the graffiti. The name of the Company also brought back bad memories of Ringing Bells, who claimed to be from the Company of the Yellow Banner.</p>
                <p>However, the party did not have luxurious time to chew on dino steaks and ponder this, as a pack of four Red Wizards with guards undead and living appeared. One, a woman named Zagmira with a face split down the middle between youthful and wizened, did most of the talking, with Voj, one of the Wizards from the previous day's ambush, and one other by her side. They demanded the remaining 3 cubes from the party â€“ but the party only possessed 2. This created quite a conundrum, as both parties eventually concluded (despite AA's best efforts to confuse the Wizards) that Ras Nsi had taken the last one. With both sides wanting the last cube, but neither side able to take on the yuan-ti on their own, Adventurers Anonymous and the Red Wizards of Thay entered into a most uneasy alliance.</p>

                <p>8 Nightal, continued: Following the striking of the wavering alliance, the Red Wizards left the scene, allowing Adventurers Anonymous to get some work done in the day. Of course, the first discussion of business was how sketchy the alliance truly was. Nobody seemed very pleased about it, least of all Artus Cimber, who figured that the Wizards had deduced he had lost the Ring to Ras Nsi. But, it would be a necessary evil it seemed, as Ras Nsi had to be dealt with â€“ for the last puzzle cube, and for the Ring.</p>
                <p>First, however, the party decided it was time to visit a few more shrines, even if they were all looted, to get some more information about the trickster gods, and to confirm the dead froghemoth the wizards had reported. Heading to the shrines of I'jin the almiraj, Wongo the su-monster, and Kubazan the froghemoth, they continued to piece together the Legend of the Trickster Gods, as well as uncover the many rivalries among them. More tangibly, it was hard to miss the hulking monstrosity beginning to rot away outside Kubazan's shrine, and through inspection of some of the arrows sticking out of its hide, Evie was able to deduce that the yuan-ti were in fact responsible for its death, and presumably the cube in the shrine within.</p>
                <p>Following this, the party returned to the Red Wizards to brainstorm an attack plan, attempting to come up with something clever using the extra spellpower of the Wizards. Eventually, the groups came up with a surgically precise tactic. At night, Chiwa would dimension door directly into Ras Nsi's secret chambers with Hugo, and Zagmira would do the same with Thazma (the Red Wizard Evie just failed to hunt down). With the element of surprise and with him completely outnumbered, they would finish him with ease, grab the cube (and, subtextually, the Ring), and dimension door back out. Meanwhile, the remaining forces of both parties would watch one entrance each, while a couple more of AA stayed behind at the re-entry point. Of course, with mutual backstabbing obvious to all, there were additional machinations. Wallace planned to sneak in, as he had so many times before, as a spider. For the Red Wizards, they didn't divulge their secret plans, but it wasn't a stretch to imagine they existed.</p>
                <p>But, the details would have to be revealed live that night. For now, the party (still bruised from their fight with the King of Feathers) took their rest that afternoon, and waited for night to strike.</p>

                <p>8 Nightal, continued: Minutes before the stroke of midnight, AA and the wizards took their places. For AA, Eku stayed with Dragonbait and Artus watching the secret entrance, while the main party took their places in action positions. Evie perched herself atop the abandoned central temple, attempting to keep an eye on the complex. Jeb stood, guns loaded, watching the meeting point from a distance. Wallace had already snuck in. And Hugo and Chiwa made their way to the teleport point, where Thazma and Zagmira met them. Meanwhile, the other wizards and their forces watched the main entrance... Or so the party thought. The seconds ticked down....</p>
                <p>9 Nightal: As midnight struck, the plan was enacted. The strike teams dimension doored in, and the battle began. But, it was a battle on two fronts. On the inside, Ras Nsi arose from his slumber, summoned swirling shields around him, and vowed to end their lives for good this time. Meanwhile, Voj had advanced with the human and skeletal guards to ambush Evie and Hugo. The betrayal was swifter than expected.</p>
                <p>On the outside, things proceeded relatively well for the heroes. Although Voj gave Evie (and Percy) some trouble by summoning a fire elemental to harass them, a few well placed shots by Hugo dispersed the elemental, and Voj was quickly dispatched as Eku and company arrived to help clean up the guards.</p>
                <p>On the inside, chaos ensued. The wizards acted swiftly by getting some early damage in on Ras Nsi, but Ras Nsi retorted by splitting his chamber with a wall of ice, leaving him alone on one side with Hugo. But, as Hugo battled, Zagmira made a reckless move, unleashing a powerful wave of negative energy striking everyone else in the room indiscriminately. The wall of ice shattered, Hugo and Chiwa were badly hurt, Thazma was knocked unconscious by her own ally, and two spiders on the wall reverted to their original forms - both Wallace and the last Wizard, Dyrax, who had copied the tactic.</p>
                <p>From there, the chaos intensified as the battle shifted from a simple two way fight to three. As the Wizards began to fight AA as well, Ras Nsi escaped via the teleporter to the balcony, where he set the temple on alert. As the parties followed after, the battle shifted once more to the throne room. (In the chaos, Chiwa briefly found himself in the harem, watching Sekelok having a torrid affair with one of the concubines. But there was no time for that anyway.) Back in Nsi's chambers, Dyrax was taken down by Chiwa, and shortly afterwards Zagmira (who had been trapped in an ice prison) retreated to the throne room as well. She attempted a desperate grab for the puzzle cube, but was struck down by Hugo's radiant maul. The Wizards were down.</p>
                <p>But, Ras Nsi wasn't. In a flurry of power, he blasted frigid cold towards the members of AA, downing Wallace. With Hugo barely standing, he unleashed a huge icy fist to pummel him. As Hugo went down, he implored Chiwa, the last man standing, to do the right thing. With a burst of inspiration, Chiwa, dumped the potion of healing he had forgotten about into Wallace's mouth, and with two perfectly placed eldritch blasts, Ras Nsi went down screaming. As Wallace came to his senses, he misty stepped past the yuan-ti guards and resuscitated Hugo. And it was Hugo, who, standing at death's door, stood above Ras Nsi's body, and brought down the hammer, smashing his skull into smithereens. Ras Nsi was slain.</p>
                <p>Wallace quickly grabbed the ring, and the wizards had been briefly looted for their cubes beforehand, so Chiwa grabbed Hugo and teleported out. Wallace, curious as ever, attempted to activate the Ring's terrible power, but nothing came of it and nobody saw him try. So, he too made his escape, leaving the broken-willed yuan-ti to their own devices.</p>
                <p>And so, the party, within an inch of their lives, regrouped, and the dust settled. Wallace handed over the Ring, and Artus quickly snatched it, thanking the party from the bottom of his heart. Eku gave everyone a proud smile, and Dragonbait shouted a scent one could only assume was that of celebration for a difficult victory. Although some of the spoils were lost, such as Ras Nsi's flame tongue longsword and Artus's magic dagger, the crucial puzzle pieces - the Ring and the 9 cubes - were in good hands.</p>
                <p>Artus then let the party know it was time to take his leave. Although it had been... "fun"... he needed to protect the Ring and find Alisanda, which supposedly (according to Saja N'baza) would be possible with Nsi's death. He wasn't sure where exactly the next step was, but he knew that he would find it.</p>
                <p>Chiwa and Wallace, however, were not going to let him simply leave. Appealing to his sense of heroism and using a touch of logic, they pointed out that his status quo was simply wandering around in the jungle some more protecting the Ring. With the Soulmonger right here - in theory, anyhow - was he really going to leave when the fate of the world could rest partially in his hands? And, perhaps the Soulmonger was the next step to Alisanda - no reason why it couldn't be. Artus, ever the reluctant hero, struggled internally with the decision, but finally agreed. However, suspecting the danger that would lie within, he would not bring the Ring - instead, he would hide it somewhere only he knew. That way, whatever lurked within would not gain it if he were to die, and if he did die, it would hopefully remain hidden for a long time to come. Dragonbait, loyal as ever, signaled he would stick with Artus as they entered the tomb, and Eku had no plans of bailing. Thus, the party, strong as ever, made plans to rest the day before taking their next steps. Towards peril, or towards glory, nobody knew. Perhaps both....</p>

            <summary>Session 45: The Tomb of Annihilation</summary>
            <div>
                <p>9 Nightal, continued: Adventures Anonymous, truly victorious this time, spent the rest of the day resting and recovering. While Artus went out to hide the Ring, Evie and Percy decided to do one last scouting session. Percy flew over the city once more, finally finding the long-sought black obelisk in the north of the city, as well as the eblis shrine. Flying over the Fane, all was quiet as the yuan-ti evidently were busy sorting out internal politics. As Artus returned ringless, the party was huddled together, pondering the 9 puzzle cubes, their gods, and the connections between them.</p>
                <p>10 Nightal: Feeling well-rested and up to the challenges ahead of them, the party began their final tour of Omu. Heading over to the eblis shrine, the party avoided some big crocodiles to clamber into Papazotl's chamber, learning the story of Papazotl and Kubazan. However, there was no need to delve into the shrine, since the cube was already in hand. The story, and Papazotl's name, were the important things. Following this, they headed to the base of the waterfall with a hunch there might be something hidden behind it, but Wallace's gust of wind revealed only a wet cliff face.</p>
                <p>Thus, they continued onwards to the area surrounding the black, moss-covered obelisk. The party split to investigate a few areas of interest. Some stared, suspicious, at the monolith. Others went to what appeared to be the door, with skulls adorning the edges and 8 puzzle cube sized slots in it. And still others went into a side corridor cut into the cliff, filled with 8 statues of the trickster gods, each with a basin of oil that lit up as the corresponding puzzle cube was brought into the hall. As Wallace brought Unkh's cube into the hallway, he saw a flickering of light at the end of the hallway, giving away a secret door that hid Unkh's statue. Above her shrine was Unkh's story, although it ended with an oddly dark twist where everyone was slaughtered. Eku did not recall this part of the story. In addition, there was a pendant in the shape of an eye hanging on Unkh's statue, which Hugo picked up.</p>
                <p>As Hugo exited and passed by the obelisk wearing the pendant, he felt it tug him towards a section of underbrush, which he parted to reveal a secret passage. At the end was a door, much like the first, but with 9 cube slots instead of 8. Suspecting the key was to place the cubes according to their rivalries, with Unkh in the middle, Hugo carefully placed them as such, and the door ominously grinded upwards. But, before they continued onward, Artus's curiosity was not satiated with regards to the obelisk, he brushed away some moss revealing a message. The message echoed, in a scratching, menacing voice, in everyone's minds - a grim prophecy from Acererak the Eternal, containing cryptic hints about the dangers of the tomb. Acererak's name was familiar to the historians in the room â€“ a malevolent, most powerful lich. Filled with dread, the party moved forward.</p>
                <p>The next room was a short hallway with a lever at the end. Wallace was quick to notice the entire floor was a pit trap. As Hugo walked towards the lever, a crystal hourglass emerged from the wall and began to tick. However, rather than pull the lever, the party remained cautious, and as the hourglass ran out, the wall slid up uneventfully, and the party was able to continue. Carefully tiptoeing across a traditionally trapped hallway, the party made their way into the Tomb.</p>
                <p>As they entered in, facing an ominous devil face with utter (magical) darkness in the mouth, a strange message played out, from someone (or something) named Withers welcoming them. In the sadistic tone of an amusement park operator, Withers welcomed them to the Tomb of the Nine Gods, also known as... the Tomb of Annihilation. But, this Withers was nowhere to be seen. Carefully exploring the floor, the party expanded out to get a lay of the land, but avoided too much conflict. Finding a grand central staircase, they noticed a figure on the floor below briefly looking at them before retreating into darkness.
                </p>
                <p>With nothing stopping them from descending, they explored the second floor a bit, finding a half-human, half-goat corpse. They picked up its staff, which they learned was cursed from Chiwa's questioning of the dead body, and that he was part of the Yellow Banner, but much remained cryptic. Deciding it was best to take things one floor at a time, the party came back up, and as they entered a room with a statue of a rusting knight, Wallace found himself magnetically attracted from the other side of the room, and had to let his gear fly away and stick to the statue to avoid being pulled himself. A dispel magic seemed to stop the effect, at least for now. Finding a secret entrance into a chamber that they had seem through a window earlier, Wallace remembered one of the hints on the obelisk: "Don the mask or be seen." Grabbing a mask from one of the corpses sitting on thrones in the room, he crept in, avoiding being spotted by a disk of flittering eyes. However, Chiwa was not so wise, and as he entered, maskless, the corpses animated, and began to attack!</p>

            <div>
                <p>10 Nightal, continued: As the corpses animated into wights, a claustrophobic battle ensued. With only one passage into the room, the fighting was close quarters for sure, although the quarters were opened a bit when Jeb barreled into the crystal window, shattering it, and letting his shots ring painfully loud in the echoing chamber. (At this juncture, Withers scolded the party for destroying the wights, as they were "part of the experience".) The enemies defeated, the sarcophagus was opened, revealing a  dusty pile of zorbo bones with a beautiful ring on top. As Wallace grabbed the ring, the spiritual form of Obo'laka the Zorbo emerged from it, and dove into Wallace's head, possessing him. Following the possession, Wallace's typical adventurousness came into conflict with a new uncertainty and aversity to risk from Obo'laka, who would begin to telepathically speak with Wallace from then on.</p>
                <p>Exploring the room following the attack, another secret door was revealed, but this one was a trap - a flint on the edge created a spark, exploding a hidden pocket of gas behind the door, scorching all near it. This didn't help Wallace's new fear of risk. Heading into the lazy underground river they saw from the grate in the hallway, Wallace heard something moving away down the river. The party began to move down the river looking for it, but couldn't find it. They did find the end of the river flowing down into a waterfall, as well as another door. Noticing a chest on a ledge at the waterfall, Evie shimmied around to check it out - but it was a mimic! It was an iconic, yet easily defeated enemy. Heading back the other way down the river, they found the source, where a chest was hanging from chains over a pool. Around the keyhole, it warned: "I devour all but the greatest thieves." Once bitten, twice shy, the party didn't feel like playing around with this one.</p>
                <p>Peeking around the rest of the floor, the party saw Moa's tomb, where the sarcophagus stood alone with a glass box containing a floating child's skull. They also saw Wongo's tomb, which contained three enchanted chests in addition to the sarcophagus in a pit. Wongo's tomb lied beyond a giant adamantine propeller, which the party jammed up using their immovable rod. Feeling worn out and not wanting to take unnecessary risks, the party returned to Obo'laka's tomb and set up a tiny hut to take a rest.</p>

            <summary>Session 47: Well, That Whole Friendship Thing Didn't Last Long</summary>
            <div>
                <p>10 Nightal, continued: As the party settled down to rest, their rest was not the most restful. Halfway through the night (or whatever time it was), they were woken by Withers announcing they were loitering, and they would have to move or he would send security. Moving didn't seem like a great option, so they kept resting. Later in the night, they were in fact ambushed, as Withers momentarily revealed himself to summon a blazing wall of fire around the party's hut, scorching Jeb (who was too large to fit inside). Then, he slipped around a corner, and sent hulking plated guardians to clean up. However, the attack was repelled easily: Chiwa dispelled the wall of fire, and Jeb pushed the guardians down the stairs, as they seemed impervious to nonmagical attacks. Withers then allowed them to rest, but not before vowing to have a better strike next time.</p>
                <p>11 Nightal, probably: As the days lost their meaning in the darkness of the Tomb of the Nine Gods, the party awoke, rested enough, and returned to the second level of the Tomb to continue exploring. Posted on the wall of the grand staircase's balcony was a plaque containing more cryptic hints as to traps in the Tomb. Stepping past the goat-like corpse, they investigated a room filled with a sarcophagus and the smell of wine, but noticing a large stone block over the entrance, suspected a wine-filled drowning would be in store for them, so they refrained from poking too much. They also poked around a large green devil head relief, with darkness and sobbing coming from the mouth. They decided not to touch that either. </p>
                <p>Continuing on the balcony, they came across a large door with 3 zombies sticking their heads out, attempting to bite anything that passed by. They were easily dispatched, and the strong fellows in the party heaved the door up. They saw a magnificent tomb beyond - with carvings of eblis on the golden carriage in the center of the room, it had to be Papazotl's. There were also cauldrons of bones lining the walls, and statues in the back. Crucially though, as they entered, they saw a secret door close. Before chasing after, they read to "Bow before no one", so many of the party members bowed before a faceless statue as they entered the room to deter waking anything up. Nothing happened good or bad, so they continued on their way towards the secret door. </p>
                <p>Beyond was a small hallway containing a dusty bottle, inside of which was somebody! Speaking in Terran, Hugo conversed with a dao in a bottle named Keshma al-Wazir, who had been trapped in the bottle and demanded to be let out. With Hugo not immediately caving, she offered to give up her jewelry. Hugo wanted to become friends with Keshma, but the feeling was not reciprocated, so he agreed to these terms, smashing the bottle. In a whirlwind of sand, Keshma emerged, handed over some beautiful jewelry, and disappeared as quickly as she had been there.</p>
                <p>Another door was at the end of the hallway, which the party opened to find a chamber with a sarcophagus, topped with grung statuettes, contained in a salt pentagram. Also in the room was a skeleton with a strange square extrusion made of metal grafted to its skull. It attempted to escape down a crawlspace, but it was shot down and identified as a Skeleton Key. A key to what wasn't clear. Jeb, feeling a bit reckless, decided to enter the salt pentagram, releasing a very angry gray slaad who slung fireballs at the party to vent its fury. Promptly beaten within an inch of its life, it vowed to get revenge on the party, then disappeared. </p>
                <p>With Nangnang's sarcophagus unprotected, Hugo heaved it open and grabbed a pearl, summoning Nangnang's spirit. He allowed it to possess him, becoming the second party member to succumb to a mental roommate. Satisfied with the progress they had made, the party descended further to the third level.</p>

            <div>
                <p>11 Nightal, continued: Heading down the stairs to the third level, Adventurers Anonymous were met with a major health violation - a mysterious purple mold growing on the floors, walls, and ceiling. Unsure of what it was, Wallace tried to clean it up with some controlled fire, but when he shot a patch to burn it up, another patch shot back. An eyestalk emerged from the mold, blasting him with an enervating ray of force. Wallace became a little bit paranoid, wanting to burn away the rest with a flaming sphere so it wouldn't continue attacking, but the rest of the party calmed him down, noting that it wasn't attacking anymore anyway. Carefully, the party continued on the floor, finding another plaque of hints. As they walked, eyes popped out of the mold to watch them.
                </p>
                <p>Heading down a corridor, Evie took the lead and came to a jackal head, which she peeked through a gap in the teeth of. She saw a gorgeous, Egyptian-themed tomb that had to be I'jin's. A golden sarcophagus sat on a barge in the center of a floor filled with hieroglyph tiles. As she looked, a dwarf came into the room, cautiously walking along the floor, when he stepped on the wrong tile and was eaten by locusts emerging from the sphinxes in the corners of the room. The party pondered who he was - Yellow Banner, perhaps? - as well as how to get into the tomb, and why he had entered at the exact moment Evie started looking. </p>
                <p>Continuing on, the party came to a hallway dripping with water, with a watery curtain in the middle splitting the hall into 2 mirrored halves. Reliefs of figures lined the walls and weapons hung from the ceiling. Noticing inscriptions on the reliefs, the party figured out a logic puzzle, walking through the curtain of water while carrying the weapons in a certain order. They also found hidden in the room 2 crystal eyeballs in bright colors.</p>
                <p>The next room was a small one - as Hugo opened the door, a shadowy duplicate 15 feet in front of him mirrored his actions precisely. Between them stood a font of steaming greenâ€¦ soup? Realizing he could step back to get the shadow to move towards the soup, he began miming drinking the soup, and the shadow slurped it up, revealing another crystal eyeball at the bottom of the cauldron. Meanwhile, around the corner was a stone block with a jackal-headed humanoid carved into it. It wore a gold medallion, which could be viewed in high detail through a peephole with a magnifying lens in it. But, the way forward was not clear, so the party returned the way they came.</p>
                <p>At this point, Chiwa decided to utilize his flying snake familiar to do some scouting of the tighter crawlways. Although some of the tunnels were seemingly pointless, one came to a large room with a giant pit interspersed with floating platforms. On one end was a lever, and the other had a fiendish statue. Flying through the room, the snake entered another tunnel, where another skeleton key - this one with a pentagonal head - attempted to stab the snake. Retreating, Chiwa ordered the snake to pull the lever, at which point howling winds filled the room. Chiwa lost control of the snake as it started speeding back towards the skeleton key to attack, at which point he unsummoned it before it finished its kamikaze attempt.</p>
                <p>Moving yet another direction, the party dispatched two tomb guardians connected by an iron chain (Hugo unleashing a MIGHTY blow to fell them both) and came across Kubazan's tomb. While there, they re-enacted scenes of prayer and tribute on the walls to unlock his sarcophagus, which contained a pair of bracers. However, when Chiwa touched them, Kubazan came out with great bravado, only to have his possession attempt repelled. Evie touched the bracers (they were bracers of archery) nextâ€¦ and Kubazan was denied again. 
                </p>
                <p>Lastly, the party decided to return to the first floor to Moa's tomb in search of any more skeleton keys. They did find a triangular skeleton key within, which they dispatched while confronted by a telepathic child's voice. Scared and apparently unable to see, the party did the bare minimum to calm it down while looting Moa's sarcophagus. A magic bow was contained inside, which Evie grabbed, allowing Moa to coinhabit her head, and the party exited the room.</p>

            <div>
                <p>11 Nightal, continued: The party, now feeling rather curious about Withers' whereabouts, decided to head down the secret stairs where the tomb guardians had come to ambush them. They emerged in a laboratory of sorts, filled with tools, rats, and a contraption that seemed to create new tomb guardians. Adventurers Anonymous fought off the guardian and some of the dwarves (which appeared to be the same ones as they had spotted early in the tomb). 
                </p>
                <p>As they searched the lab, they came across a unique item - a lantern with a figure inside! This figure, vague and seemingly forgetful, called herself the Starfallen. It seemed she had been traveling with the Company of the Yellow Banner before they were broken apart in the tomb. She seemed to be helpful, limited as she was by her fading memory and being in a lantern.</p>
                <p>Exiting the room, the party came across some of the backrooms. A spiral staircase wound down deeper into the dungeon, and more importantly was Withers' office, complete with a plaque listing him as Tomb Custodian. The party prepared for combat, but when Hugo opened the door, Hugo and Withers instead had a rather pleasant conversation with no conflict. He closed the door once again. The party seriously questioned what the hell Hugo was doing, and Jeb decided he was going to take things into his own hands. Busting open the door and raising his gun, Withers gave a wry smile and clutched his amulet, disappearing and taking the valuables in the room with him.</p>
                <p>A search of his office turned up some tomes on Chultan and Omuan history, as well as some assorted, highly creepy journals. However, there was a tomb to explore. Heading into a small secret room, they found some sort of scrying pool. They watched through a tomb guardian's eyes as it wandered through the tomb somewhere - that is, until it noticed it was being looked through, and emerged from the pool to attack.
                </p>
                <p>Following this, the party went through a bit of a grand tour of the 3rd floor, accessing some secret rooms via the spiral staircase. They explored tunnels, secret rooms, and finally handled the wind room and got the skeleton key, using mage hand and the Starfallen's limited ability to manipulate things to grab the treasure and control the winds from safety. Hugo's ability to walk on the ceiling came in handy as well. They also came to some sort of door with 10 eyeball-sized slots â€“ seemingly the purpose of those crystal eyes. There was also a suspicious golden skull sitting alone in a room, over which Nangnang and Hugo got into an argument about whether to take it or not. In fact, Hugo actually attempted to replace Nangnang with Kubazan, but Nangnang fought him off. Wallace did the same thing, also to no success, before Nangnang, rejected by every other member of the party, finally found his home in Jeb's head.</p>
                <p>As their last task before settling down for the day, the party investigated an eerie room, with curtains showing a scene of nobility turning into depravity and chaos and fear. At the end of this was a rotting boar's head, which lured those who gazed upon it to stick their heads into its mouth â€“ but Hugo was the only one looking, and his devotion made him impervious to the charm. He destroyed the head, grabbing a few non-magical trinkets lodged in the teeth. After this, the party decided they'd had a full day of adventuring â€“ however long it actually had been was unclear â€“ and settled down to rest. Not unsurprisingly, Withers attempted once more to ambush them, but was fended off once again, and Withers was unable to get a solid surprise strike in. He vowed that next time, things would get real.</p>

            <summary>Session 50: Mirror, Mirror, On The Wall</summary>
            <div>
                <p>12 Nightal: Continuing their descent down to the 4th floor, Adventurers Anonymous carefully began their exploration of the bone covered halls, finding massive four-armed gargoyles, more riddles, and so on. Coming to a short staircase with a chest at the foot and a chamber beyond, the party used their immovable rod to jam a ceiling compartment, allowing them to remove the chest. Looking inside, it appeared empty, but feeling around let Evie find an invisible key, which she strung on a necklace. Removing the immovable rod, a huge boulder rolled down the stairs and into a hidden pit of acid. The party did not continue into the chamber.</p>
                <p>Heading down another hallway, Hugo, Evie, and Wallace turned to their right to find a room containing only a mirror. As they looked at it, Hugo disappeared. Heading down to see what the commotion was, Artus looked at the mirror, and disappeared. With the rest of the party panicked, Evie and Wallace were the only ones in the hallway as they cautioned nobody else to join them. Looking for clues, they headed into an ominous maze, finding a hexagonal skeleton key, but no way to find their missing party members.</p>
                <p>Eventually, Chiwa decided to take his chances and walk up to the mirror, avoiding ill circumstances and identifying the mirror. It was a mirror of life trapping, and his magic revealed the command words to disable the mirror and free or speak to those trapped within. In order to find Hugo and Artus, they needed to check out each cell. The prisoners were a motley crew, including an angry troll, a stirge, and an insane Omuan. Of note were a few prisoners: a drow mage named Xlad who was trapped visiting the city; a member of the Yellow Banner, Biff Longsteel; and a guard of Queen Napaka named Lukanu, with her loyal minotaur in another cell. After much argument between Hugo (who was freed along with Artus), Wallace, Evie, and the party at large, they came to the compromise to free Biff only, who began tagging along.</p>
                <p>With the skeleton key in hand, there seemed to be no need to linger on the floor, so they went back up one level to the spiral staircase and descended further. They considered re-entering the 4th floor from the staircase, but hearing movement in the room beyond, instead decided to descend further. Coming to the bottom of the stairs, they continued past a hall filled with grey slime to find a perpendicular hallway with a curtain at one end and the words "AWAKEN NAPAKA!" scrawled in blood on the ceiling. Heading the other way, the party saw a sight: an enormous pentagonal room on a giant gear. In the gear was a rusty sprinkler and lots of decaying plant matter. It connected to a second giant gear, pock-marked and decorated with five black dragon friezes. From there, that second gear led to a control panel, with mysterious unmarked controls: a blue dial and button, a red dial and button, and a gold lever. A diagram on the wall showed various positions of three gears, and pipes above it were lined with dregs of grey slime. </p>
                <p>Wanting to get to the third gear room, the orientations were such that there was no direct path from the control room to the third gear. Thus, it was necessary to... split the party! Evie, Jeb, Artus and Dragonbait headed over to the plant gear, with everyone else remaining in the control room. Wallace fiddled with the controls somewhat randomly, using the blue dial to adjust the selected gear orientation. When he pressed the blue button, the entire floor rumbled as the gears rotated. But, there was trouble: as the plant gear finished its rotation, poison gas began to pour out from a northern chamber, and as it did, three plant creatures were awoken from the floor and attacked!</p>

            <div>
                <p>12 Nightal, continued: As the gears finished rotating and the poison began to spill out and awaken the three shambling mounds in the room, Evie, Jeb, Dragonbait, and Artus found themselves in a grueling battle. With the plant creatures hitting hard and showing incredible endurance, and the poison gas continuing to seep through their skin, the combatants found themselves quickly injured. Calling out for help, the rest of the party began to rotate the gears back the other way, as Evie in the chaos decided to jump over to the third, unexplored gear. Meanwhile, Jeb, Dragonbait and Artus would finish up the fight badly wounded, fighting from the open entrances of the gear to avoid the gas as it spilled out of the room. The rest of the party came to finish up the fight, and successfully vanquished the mounds. However, Evie was now on her own!</p>
                <p>While the rest of the party reoriented themselves, Evie did a little bit of solo exploration. Looking around the gear, she saw 5 wardrobes on the walls, each with a different grisly scene on the doors. To the north, a portcullis was shut, with 5 crystals like drops of blood above it. To the south, a passageway led to a semicircular room with an ornate golden mastodon in the center, and murals of devils on the walls. </p>
                <p>With the poison gas still ready to flow out if the gears were moved again, it was impractical for the whole party to make it across to the third gear. But Wallace came over, and using his charm from Saja N'baza, entered a gaseous form to explore the floor overall. The rest of the party rested as Wallace shifted through the portcullis, seeing a long hallway with scattered debris and a staircase down. At the other end was a room crackling with blue lightning and massive chains rising and falling into vortices at the top and bottom of the room. He also flew around over the lake, which was illuminated by phosphorescent crabs - and he saw something dark darting around beneath the water. The tomb dwarves were also present, doing some repairs on one of the gears but otherwise avoiding confrontation. Finally, he found an octagonal skeleton key hiding in the room where the poison gas was, and eventually chased it over to Evie, who shot it down and retrieved it.
                </p>
                <p>Eventually, Evie and Wallace made their way back to the rest of the party at the control panel, and they began fiddling with the rest of the controls. One of the controls allowed the occupants of the room to telepathically talk with a creature living in the lake called G'lyh'rul. Its personality seemed to change for each chat, although even when it was acting cheery it was clearly evil, admitting that it was waiting for the rise of a death god and the fall of divinity. Another control caused great concern as an iron sheet slammed down over the room's entrance and trapped everyone inside (except, ironically, Evie again). There was no apparent way to raise the iron sheet, but after physically manipulating the control panel's base enough, the party managed to slightly damage the base, allowing them to see into a secret crawlspace beneath it. Chiwa summoned his familiar, which pulled a lever, moving the control panel aside and allowing everyone (but Jeb) into the crawlspace. Following it led to a room with an armillary sphere showing the positions of Toril, the moon Selune, and other celestial bodies. There were controls inside, but nobody dared touch them.</p>
                <p>After a while, the iron sheet lifted on its own, and the party returned to the "AWAKEN NAPAKA!" hall. Pulling aside the curtain at one end, a four-armed gargoyle held a short riddle, which was solved by giving it 9 gemstones the party had acquired throughout their travels. Solving it revealed a powerful treasure - the Eye of Zaltec. The Eye was a huge ruby, rumored to be able to raise the dead - for the price of other's lives. It was also an ancient Chultan relic, and Eku felt strongly that it should be retrieved from the tomb and stay with her, and not in the hands of Hugo and his greedy copilot Nangnang. There was much argument over what to do, but eventually Eku won out. However, when she grabbed the Eye, a cloud of gas put her to sleep as a secret door opened and revealed a stone juggernaut barreling down towards her unconscious body!</p>

            <div>
                <p>12 Nightal, continued: As the juggernaut barreled towards an unconscious Eku, Hugo immediately took action with his catlike reflexes, jumping into the hallway and whisking Eku and the Eye of Zaltec to safety. Given the narrowness of the hall, the stone juggernaut was not able to turn itself, and so the party got off scoff-free.</p>
                <p>The next question was how to get everyone down the stairs on the opposite side of the floor. Debating between the secret path under the control panel and messing with the gears and the 5 wardrobes, they first decided to head to the secret path, investigating the armillary sphere. Chiwa was the bold participant to hop into the control seat and began reorienting the rings. But, as he did so, the sphere of the moon exploded! From out of it leapt a monster (later identified as a nycaloth) with a giant greataxe, but it was disoriented and taken down by Hugo's mighty swings before it could swing back. At this point, the party decided not to mess with the armillary sphere any further.</p>
                <p>Instead, Adventurers Anonymous took the necessary, yet still not very wise step of splitting the party â€“ somebody had to stay behind to man the controls, after all! One half stayed to man the controls and the other half traveled carefully across the cogs to the furthest one with the 5 wardrobes, all decorated with ghastly scenes. Opening each wardrobe one by one, the party gazed out onto various scenes of the Outer Planes and from each faced a battle of its combatants. (Except the wardrobe from Mechanus, which spat out a disoriented modron. Hugo crushed it anyway.) As each trial was conquered, the 5 lights above the portcullis out from the gear lit up, and with the last one finished, the portcullis rose.</p>
                <p>The party regathered themselves together in the cog, but faced an additional challenge â€“ the hallway they had just unlocked destroyed any and all equipment tossed into it. There was some sort of ring on the other side of the hallway that seemed suspicious, but with no way to pull it remotely, the party came to a simple (and, as it turns out, highly awkward) solution. Evie turned invisible using Moa's powers, and stripped completely, allowing her to pass with no equipment damage and pull the ring, disabling the effect. However, instead of heading down the stairs, they decided to hole up in the cog for another rest.</p>
                <p>At night, things got tense. As they rested, what seemed to be Biff himself wandered from the hall, with his mouth sewn shut. He telepathically warned the party that the Biff resting within their Leomund's Tiny Hut was a doppelganger, and he was the real Biff, and had been tortured by a group known as the Sewn Sisters. The original Biff naturally denied this all, leading to a heated exchange as the party attempted to figure out which Biff, if any, was telling the truth. Neither seemed willing to answer questions within a zone of truth, but when Hugo came around with a detect evil and good spell active, the second Biff decided the gig was up, revealing himself as the gray slaad from a couple days ago!</p>
                <p>The slaad lobbed a fireball to start the combat, and shortly afterwards, Withers made himself known, peeking around the corner to lob spells. But, he forgot to step out of range of Chiwa, who unleashed a critical counterspell against him, swinging the tempo of the battle against Withers. Without his control spells landing, Withers was helpless, and Hugo rushed up to fell him with a powerful strike straight to the head, finishing the nuisance of a wight for good. The gray slaad, beaten within an inch of its life once again, disappeared. It once again vowed revenge â€“ but it would not find it.</p>
                <p>The party then settled down to finish their rest, but Evie would not find the rest she sought. Convulsing on the ground, she was overtaken by seizure-inducing dreams of a horrifying, black entity.</p>

            <summary>Session 53: The Trials of the Sewn Sisters</summary>
            <div>
                <p>13 Nightal: With Adventurers Anonymous intact and well-rested - except the nightmare-plagued Evie - the party headed down the stairs to the next level. As they neared the bottom, they saw green smoke billowing around on the lower level. Discerning it was not poisonous, they came into a mysterious workshop. Filled with random knick-knacks and tools, it also had a cauldron in the center with a tar-like substance in it, and a cage in the corner. At the back end of the room, a green gate filled with skulls was barely visible, and on either side, two upper galleries held 5 doors, each adorned with one of a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, or octagon.
                </p>
                <p>Hugo placed the lid on the cauldron, and as the smoke dissipated, three dolls emerged from the back of the room: A straw doll with pins sticking out of it, named Strawbundle; a faceless clay doll, fittingly named Clay No-Face; and a stuffed monkey with the lower half of a unicycle, named Joho. Strawbundle, speaking with the voice of a young girl, did most of the talking, as Joho couldn't speak through his stuffing, and Clay No-Face had to mold his own mouth to speak. Strawbundle explained that they were the trapped souls of children, stuffed into these forms by a coven of night hags called the Sewn Sisters. She warned the party they were nursing some sort of creature behind the green skeleton gate, and that if the party wished to unlock it, they'd have to withstand five trials on the upper balconies. Finally, she told the party that the Sisters had a "lookie-like" they were torturing to get information about the party. Over in the cage, a shivering, sickly copy of none other than Motinui was huddled under a blanket. His memories seemed somehow linked to those of Hugo, Chiwa, Wallace, and Evie, as he remembered things they had done that Motinui hadn't been there for. However, most of the party, save Eku and to some extent Evie, had little remorse for their gone-mad ex-party member, who begged to be released from the Sewn Sister's clutches. Instead, the party began the trials, hopping back and forth between the five rooms as they got ideas and theories about their solutions.</p>
                <p>In the triangle room, a glass cylinder was filled with light and a heavy iron lever. However, only a 1 inch triangular hole allowed entry into the cylinder, and with mage hands and the Starfallen lacking the strength to pull the lever, it was unclear how to get at it. But, Wallace used his druidic powers to transform into an octopus, capable of squeezing through even the tightest spaces, and oozed through the hole. Wrapping himself around the lever, he pulled the lever, and one of the seals on the skeleton gate slid away to reveal the first keyhole.</p>
                <p>The square room was filled with flying pages, each of which seemed to be a different spell scroll.  On the other side of the room, a lever was visible, but it appeared ghostly and couldn't be touched. The party snatched few of the pages from the air, and the rest disintegrated. The dust coalesced into a impish creature, which, when slain, transformed again into a stick of black chalk. With a square drawn around the phantom lever, the lever became corporeal, and the second seal slid away.</p>
                <p>The pentagon room was a wonderful feast! A gaunt butler silently prepared a meal of roast boar, squash soup, iced cakes, and frothy bear. Hugo was the first to enter, but wasn't inclined to eat anything (despite Nangnang's lust for the cakes). However, when he exited, he was overcome with incredible hunger, which had to be cured magically. Thus, when a few party members entered again next, they partook of the feast, gaining some minor benefits. On the tapestry on the wall, Wallace noticed a subliminal demon face pattern. Reaching through the mouth found a secret space for the third lever.</p>
                <p>In the hexagon room, there was a broken hexagonal mirror on the wall with the words "PIGGY PIGGY PIGGY" scrawled onto it. Lighting five candles on a shelf, plus an out of sight sixth candle, speaking "PIGGY" thrice revealed a lever that appeared only to exist in the mirror itself. Some maneuvering of the mirror allowed for the lever to be pulled. </p>
                <p>Finally, the octagon room held a lectern with book glued to it, in which a short rhyme was written in Infernal. There appeared to be a seam in the floor; a potential trap. Harnessing themselves to the wall, Chiwa and Evie remained in the room. The rhyme seemed to be readable either front to back or vice versa; Chiwa trusted his party's intuition and read it out loud back to front, revealing a secret compartment with the final lever. </p>
                <p>The party regathered in the central room, as they began to hear eerie music. Then, suddenly, the three Sewn Sisters appeared! They looked just as they had in the party's collective nightmare so long ago, and they told the party their path ended here. A battle ensued, where the hags attempted to use their guile and spellcasting power to steal one of the party's skeleton keys. But, the party's collective might was overwhelming, and the hags were forced to retreat empty-handed, but with their lives intact. With the Sewn Sisters defeated, Eku gave a heartfelt speech thanking the party for their companionship and valor, and urging them not to forget their mission. Handing each of her companions (and friends!) a private note, the party went in for a group hug. Then, Flump, Hugo, Evie, Wallace, and Chiwa each took one of the five skeleton keys, inserted them into the keyholes, and turned them. With a mighty lurch, the door opened, and the fate of Adventurers Anonymous - and the whole world! - awaited themâ€¦.</p>

            <summary>Session 54: FINALE</summary>
            <div>
                <p>13 Nightal, continued: As the skeleton gate creaked open ominously, Adventurer's Anonymous gathered their power, their speed, their fortitude; their cunning, their instincts, and their courage, and stepped down the stairs to an uncertain fate.</p>
                <p>Our heroes - Evie and Percy, Dr. Wallace Woodward, Chiwa, Hugo, and Jeb, with their companions Eku, Artus Cimber, Dragonbait, and Biff Longsteel - headed 20 feet down the stairs, and the gate slammed shut behind them as they beheld a terrible sight. They stood in an enormous triangular room on a landing dotted with alcoves filled with bones. Occupying much of the room was a pit of lava, with two balconies across the lava holding various vessels inscribed with dark sigils. On the other side of the room, an archway of bone stood inert. But, the real horror of the room was in the center. Suspended by three adamantine struts, a huge device glowed above the pit of lava. Within the glass, the forms of dead souls swirled about, softly wailing. From the top of the device, four long tentacles stretched, but most crucially, there was an umbilical cord. The twisted cord connected to a revolting creature - a floating, malformed infant floated, bloated, uttering gibberish in Celestial as it fed off this device. The creature was known as an atropal - effectively, the undead infant child of a god. The device could only be one thing: The Soulmonger.</p>
                <p>Nothing immediately attacked the party, which stood unsure of what to do in the sight of the Soulmonger and the monstrosity it fed. Acting off Obo'laka's advice, the party first cleared the alcoves of their bones, which seemed to be the remains of Omuans and their minotaurs. The party then discussed how to destroy the evil in their sight. Should they destroy the Soulmonger first? The atropal? Both? Would destroying the struts drop the Soulmonger in the lava? The answers were unclear. However, they knew they had to take action, and so they took aim. However, as they did, the creature recognized it was being threatened, and began to wail and scream as battle began.</p>
                <p>The party began their assault, attacking the Soulmonger directly, the adamantine struts, and the creature with all their power. However, they were not able to do so without withstanding attacks themselves. The Soulmonger attempted to protect itself with the tentacles sprouted from it, which grabbed Dragonbait as he hacked at the strut, and threatened to throw him into the lava. However, quick work from the party chopped the tentacles down before they could move Dragonbait. Meanwhile, the atropal took a more offensive approach, spitting up a wraith to attack the party, while shooting rays of freezing cold out to those that attacked it. All the while, it wailed a hideous, maddening wail, causing the party to continually act bizarrely, freeze up, and hallucinate until they could force their minds to push through the insanity. This effect caused Eku, in her true form, to freeze up at a crucial time, allowing the wraith to get a grievous life-draining attack against her, wounding her badly.</p>
                <p>Despite this, Eku and the rest of the party continued their attack on all fronts. Hugo used divine power to smite down the wraith; Eku and Dragonbait fought off the tentacles; Evie and Artus shot at the strut; and Jeb, Wallace, and Chiwa shot, flung stones at, and blasted with eldritch might at the Soulmonger. (Biff, gone mad, cowered in a corner.) Eventually, taking careful aim, Jeb shot the final blow at the terrible artifact. The glass shattered, and the souls trapped within swirled upwards out of sight. Then, with a blinding burst of energy, the Soulmonger burst open and was destroyed for good. The atropal shrieked, but it too was destined to fall soon, as Hugo rushed over with Nangnang's mobility to once again flex his divine power. The radiant energy coursed through the creature, and with a few powerful blows, black ichor spewed out of the atropal, and its wails ceased as it was reduced to a shriveled form, falling into the lava for it to be incinerated for good.</p>
                <p>The deed was done! The Soulmonger destroyed! Yet Eku, seemingly knowing something the party didn't, warned that the fight was not over. The Adventurers Anonymous healed up as quickly as they could and prepared for whatever else was to come, and after a few seconds, two entities appeared near the archway on the other side of the room. The first, a perfect sphere of utter darkness, was a sphere of annihilation. Yet even the destructive artifact paled in comparison to the skeletal, hateful form of its master. On the balcony stood Acererak the Eternal.</p>
                <p>Acererak surveyed the party, and spoke to them. He expressed his disgust and irritation at the party's meddling in his affairs. Yet, before the attacks came in, he started with verbal attacks, mocking each of his foes individually. He ridiculed Artus for having failed to find his wife, and laughed at the fate of Dragonbait's nearly extinct race. Biff he revealed was a doppelganger named Pox this whole time, much to the fury of the rest of the party. He promised a quick death to Eku. He mocked Evie for following in her parents' footsteps, and Wallace for his savagery. He taunted Jeb for his lack of intelligence, and Hugo for his lack of conviction. And for Chiwa, he expressed his disappointment that his own warlock would fail him and turn to the side of good. However, Acererak was not the only one to have some choice words, as Moa, Nangnang, Kubazan, and Obo'laka emerged from their hosts to cry out for vengeance against their killer. Bestowing their hosts with fortitude and strength, the true battle began, as Adventurers Anonymous faced off against the legendary archlich.
                </p>
                <p>Jeb was the first to act, immediately taking aim, setting off a few powerful shots against him, which even cut through his magical defenses. Acererak, not able to get a chance to use his most powerful magic early, used more minor spells to last the turn, attempting to slow down the party and maneuver himself above the lava and out of range of Hugo's threatening attacks. Taking a few hits as he went, he eventually got the chance to unleash his true power. With a mighty gesture, he summoned the mightiest of mortal magicks and froze time. When time resumed for everyone else, Hugo, Chiwa, and Biff (Pox) had been sequestered away behind a wall of force, while Artus, Dragonbait, and Evie were badly injured by an immense fireball. From there, the tides seemed to shift in the lich's favor, as he gained battlefield control while avoiding most hits. Eku, still injured from before, lunged directly at him, but it was no use. Repelling her, Acererak flung an arcing bolt of lightning using her body as a conduit, and Eku fell into the lava and was no more. Dragonbait, brave as ever but unable to reach Acererak for a melee attack, leapt at him hovering over the lava and grappled him midair to get a swing in, yet Acererak shortly afterwards teleported away, causing Dragonbait to fall towards the lava as well, only to be barely caught by Artus. The two of them hung over the edge like a chain. Eventually, Acererak had had enough - with a point of his finger, a green ray sprung out and turned Artus to dust. Wallace, thinking fast to again save Dragonbait from certain death in the lava, took his place hanging on the edge. 
                </p>
                <p>Yet, despite the deaths, the party kept fighting. Although Jeb and Chiwa were more or less trapped, and Acererak seemed to have endless magical reserves, Acererak could not prevent every attack. Slowly but surely, Wallace's slings, Evie's arrows, and a couple well timed swings from Hugo as Acererak faltered in his positioning wore down the necromancer, who could not break through the endurance the trickster gods had granted the heroes. And so, eventually, even as things looked dire, Acererak could risk the fight no longer. He vowed the adventurers would meet him again and perish, and disappeared.
                </p>
                <p>The party was left shell-shocked. They had won, but it felt hollow, as they mourned the loss of Artus and Eku. Chiwa sobbed in an alcove, overcome with emotion. Dragonbait smelt of roses as he stared at the pile of dust where his companion once stood. Jeb, in the heat of the moment, tussled with Pox, attempting to shove him into the lava until they were broken up, as the rest of the party was left weary from the bloodshed. And Hugo renounced Umberlee for failing to protect his friends, dropping his holy symbol into the lava. Yet, there was nothing more to do. The party tossed the vessels on the balconies - identified to be phylacteries - into the lava, and headed towards the gate at the back of the room. It swirled with mist, and the party made their way through one by one.
                </p>
                <p>The party - what remained of it, anyhow - emerged in front of the Tomb at the black obelisk they had been told of in a vision so long ago. The trickster gods thanked their hosts for the time they had spent together, before fading away. Pox, thanking the party for allowing him to live despite his deceit, ran off into the bushes. And with that, the party's quest was complete. The Death Curse was no more, and the world was saved.</p>

        <details class="session-log">
            <summary>Epilogue</summary>
            <div>
                <p>Over the next few weeks, Adventurers Anonymous trekked their way back to Port Nyanzaru. As they exited the city of Omu, Strawbundle congratulated the party for their success and thanked them for helping her, Joho, and Clay No-Face escape. However, she said that the only way to set their souls free was to destroy their doll forms. So, the party destroyed the dolls and let the souls of the children find rest. As they went back up the River Soshenstar, they passed by Camp Vengeance, still controlled by undead, and Camp Righteous, still unconquered. Weary and eager to return to the city, they passed them by. </p>
                <p>Upon returning to Port Nyanzaru, the city's mood seemed much happier. The heroes were quickly called to Goldenthrone, where the Merchant Princes informed them that the Death Curse had ended worldwide. Those who were suffering were now recovering, and some of those who had died were able to be raised, although some were gone for good. The Princes thanked the party for their service, and Wakanga told them that they, along with some other wealthy benefactors, would fund some powerful resurrection powers for those the party lost along the way.</p>
                <p>Heading across the sea (and paying Aremag's tax) to the Great Temple of Savras in Neverwinter near Evie's home at the Neverwinter Academy, the party discussed who they would raise. The obvious choices were Eku and Artus. However, the party worried that Eku might not be willing to return. To check this hypothesis, the clerics of Savras set up a ritual, allowing them to speak with Eku as if she were alive. Eku was happy to see them, but told the party that it was her time, and she had duties in the afterlife she was bound to as well. Thus, she could not return. The party, saddened but eventually understanding, said their goodbyes to their longtime friend, who blew them a kiss as the ritual ended. In that moment, Hugo rededicated his holy vows not to Umberlee, but in honor of Eku and her virtues.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Artus Cimber had much unfinished business to attend to, and a wife to find, so he was more than grateful to be brought back. As the true resurrection spell formed a new body for Artus, he immediately went to embrace Dragonbait, and then thanked the party for resurrecting him, remarking how uncomfortable being turned to dust was and advising the party not to follow suit.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Artus Cimber had much unfinished business to attend to, and a wife to find, so he was more than grateful to be brought back. As the true resurrection spell formed a new body for Artus, he immediately went to embrace Dragonbait, and then thanked the party for resurrecting him, remarking how uncomfortable being turned to dust was and advising the party not to follow suit.</p>
                <p>With the funds for one more resurrection, the party decided that their old companion Trippin deserved another chance at life. As Trippin was brought back, he looked around disoriented, before eventually figuring out what was happening. He expressed a desire to go see his father, and so he set across the sea to Chult once more.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>And so it was that the party formally split, although it was not the end of the story for any of them. Here is what became of the adventurers, their companions, foes, and allies, and the land as a whole.</p>
                <p>Over time, the presence of the undead in the jungle lessened. Danger yet remained across the island, but without Ras Nsi there, nor Acererak's machinations, the threat was less. Some harmony restored itself - as harmonious as the deadly jungle could be.</p>
                <p>In the city of Port Nyanzaru, prosperity remained with the city for some time. Over time, the sway of the city turned away from the Flaming Fist, causing them to lose some influence, although they were not truly gone. The Order of the Gauntlet, still reeling from their defeats at Camps Righteous and Vengeance, would refrain from further expeditions into the jungle for some time. Eventually, as the undead lessened, they would begin to make journeys out once more, although this time with the help of Chultan guides. Meanwhile, the Zhentarim (including River, Flask, and Rokah), Harpers, and Emerald Enclave continued their business more or less as usual.</p>
                <p>The Red Wizards, who were working with Valindra Shadowmantle, were frustrated from their losses in Omu, but more frustrated that the Soulmonger had been destroyed - they had hoped to take it and use it for their own purposes. With that gone, they more or less retreated to Thay, although some remained in the continued pursuit of Artus and the Ring of Winter.</p>
                <p>In Omu, Fenthaza ruled over the Fane of the Night Serpent, at least until the next mutiny. She sent parties into the Tomb on occasion to search for an old yuan-ti artifact of legend, but they never returned. The city's ruins remained more or less under their control.</p>
                <p>Biff, or as he was truly known, Pox, was never seen again. He slunk into the jungle around Omu, and more or less fended for himself, living a simple life of survival and neutrality.</p>
                <p>Artus continued his search for the true Mezro, with Dragonbait at his side. Some of the party would help him with research and divination to find the next steps on his quest, sending him off to distant lands, but eventually back to Chult once more. The Ring of Winter stayed buried in the ground for now, where only Artus knew. He decided it was safer this way.</p>
                <p>Trippin, upon returning to Chult, became a gladiator, living out his days of glory. He demanded Ifan Tal'roa, his adopted father, announce that he was his son, which eventually Ifan did do. </p>
                <p>Jeb returned to Chult as well, returning to his roots. He lived out his days with his family, raising them to greatness, and hunted the biggest game the jungle would bring him. The game was big, but the feasts were bigger.</p>
                <p>Hugo bought a ship, placing not a mermaid on the figurehead, but a winged serpent. He set off with course unknown towards adventure, not fearing Umberlee as he once had, and sought out the opportunity to serve the world as Eku did.</p>
                <p>Wallace had a variety of experiences. He would jump back and forth between serving as Hugo's first mate, writing novels, guest lecturing at universities, and generally adventuring.</p>
                <p>Evie followed a similar path, alternating between semesters of teaching and semesters of exploration and adventure. She spent a lot of time further mapping out Chult, as well as running into the rest of the old gang and Artus on occasion to meet up and help out.</p>
                <p>And Chiwa, mysterious as ever, spent most of his days secretively. Although the rest of the party took interest in it, Chiwa dedicated his life to finding and taking down Acererak. Over the years, he aged little, and many decades in the future, Chiwa simply disappeared.</p>
                <p>And of course, Acererak yet lived, although he did not build another Soulmonger in three weeks as he taunted. Nor did he track down the party to enact vengeance - he was in no rush - although he would attempt to kill any of their descendants in the future. (The Sewn Sisters were not so lucky, and were killed for their cowardice and for failing to protect the atropal.) Acererak stayed in the shadows, continuing his various plots. However, those plots are stories for another time, and perhaps another band of adventurersâ€¦.</p>
                <p>THE END</p>
