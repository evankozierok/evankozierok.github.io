    <p>I currently DM a Tomb of Annihilation campaign for five good friends I met through previous D&D campaigns and have stuck with since. They've been exploring Chult since August 2021 and I've been keeping session logs for every session, unless I forget to. Please enjoy the adventures of Hugo, Evie, Dr. Wallace Woodward, Chiwa, and <span class="strikeout">Motinui</span> <span class="strikeout">Trippin</span> Flump!</p>

        <summary>Session 1: The Party Assembles... Sans One</summary>
        <div>
            <p>We start our adventure on the fine 2nd day of Kythorn, 1494. A lizardfolk postdoc, Dr. Wallace Woodward; a halfling professor, Dr. Evelyn (Evie) Brightwood; and a tabaxi fisherman, Hugo; have been sailing aboard the Silver Sailor on their way to Chult for about a week now. Led on the water by the gruff Captain Tyrol Quicksilver, our three heroes spend some time getting to know the flamboyant gnome Volo, as well as a half-orc priestess of Torm, Undril Silvertusk. A quiet figure of a Chultan man also lurks, standing more solitary.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, with a splashing sound, the passengers see a purple triton backpedaling towards the boat with a set of four drums. Helping him aboard, they learn his name is Motinui, and he begins to play some Hawaiian-sounding music to raise the spirits of the crew. With Dr. Woodward feeling hungry, Hugo offers to try to catch him some fish, but it is Motinui who is able to get the first bite. However, more bites would be coming soon, as the rest of the party noticed a pack of 5 plesiosauruses fighting over an octopus, 3 of which decided that the party looked tastier.</p>
            <p>Motinui jumped into the water and tried to communicate a sense of danger to the beasts. He successfully deterred one, but the other two were unfazed, and the closer of them took a huge bite out of Motinui, nearly swallowing him in one bite. They eventually repelled the beast, which fled after being badly injured. They were able to finish off the other one and hoist it aboard for its meat, but not before it got a good bite into Hugo, who had also jumped in to protect Motinui.</p>
            <p>The next morning, feeling somewhat rested, the party awoke to a stormier day. Off in the distance, they noticed a ship nearly silhouetted, but that seemed to glimmer just a bit. The ship began to gain on them, and it became clear they flew a black pirate flagâ€¦.</p>
        </div>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 2: Aremag Would Like to Formally Welcome You to Chult</summary>
        <div>
            <p>3 Kythorn, continued: As the mysterious pirate ship gained on the Silver Sailor, the heroes began to think of ways to outpace the pirates. In a combination of standard ship work, inspiring performance, prayer to Umberlee, and a successful shot through the pirate's sail, the crew managed to steer themselves to clearer water and convince their adversaries they weren't worth the trouble. The Chultan man commended the party for their work and introduced himself as Rokah, suggesting that they seemed capable and he might have a job for them in the port. Captain Quicksilver informed the ship they should arrive the next day.</p>
            <p>4 Kythorn: After a dry and uneventful morning, as the ship grew closer and closer to Chult, out of nowhere Aremag the Dragon Turtle rose from the deep and DEMANDED TRIBUTE! Strapped for cash and with everyone but Rokah being caught unaware, Aremag grew impatient, slapping the ship with his tail, sending Hugo, Motinui, Captain Quicksilver, and much of the crew overboard into shark infested waters. All but one of the crew managed to clamber ashore, while those still on board looked suspiciously at Volo, who falsely claimed he didn't have much money with him. Motinui snatched his coin purse, and looking foolish, went to go get some more cash while Evie followed behind to ensure he didn't do anything stupid. While Volo went up with more gems, Evie also snagged a copy of Volo's Guide to Monsters. Finally appeased, Aremag slunk into the water.</p>
            <p>Finally, in the afternoon, the party arrived at Port Nyanzaru, witnessing the fragrant smells, beautiful people and art, and of course the dinosaurs. There they met Chiwa, a Chultan street urchin no older than 15 or 16 who offered himself as a city guide in exchange for food and lodgings. They arranged appointments to meet with Ekene-Afa and Wakanga O'tamu within a couple of days, and seeked out Rokah for more details on getting work. He told them he needed an escort to Fort Beluarian, and to create a distraction so he could tie the Flaming Fist to the pirates that had plagued them the day before. He also introduced them to River Mist and Flask of Wine, who suggested they gear up for travel. </p>
            <p>5 Kythorn: After a relaxing rest in Kaya's House of Repose, the party went for a bit of shopping and prepared to go to the dinosaur races later that day in an attempt to win some money.</p>
        </div>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 3: The Dinosaur Race</summary>
        <div>
            <p>5 Kythorn, continued: The party made their way to Tiryki Anchorage, where Motinui scanned the dinosaurs for a worthy ride. He quickly bonded with Nasty Boy, a young allosaurus, and chose him as his trusty steed for the race. After everyone placed some bets, the dinosaur races were off, pitting the newcomer Motinui against Ortimay Swift and Dark, Faroul and Gondolo, Salida, and the crowd favorite Tiryk. Despite an aggressive start slowing Nasty Boy due to exhaustion right out the gates, luck and skill conspired in Motinui's favor, and he managed to win the race, earning himself cash, an invitation to dine with a merchant prince of his choice, and the key to Port Nyanzaru. </p>
            <p>After the race, with his new earnings, Motinui struck a deal to purchase Nasty Boy from his trainer in exchange for a down payment and 25% of his future winnings. The whole party then went to the Thundering Lizard, where they celebrated with tej and greasy pub food. While there, Chiwa overheard a tall tale of a ghost town looking over the Aldani Basin. As the night partied on, suddenly horns and bells started ringing through the city. The party went to investigate and discovered the city was under attack by undead once again, and the Temple of Tymora was in danger. Offering to lend a helping hand, they found themselves face to face with a small horde of zombies and skeletons, led by an undead figure with an ominous blue triangle on its forehead.</p>
        </div>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 4: The Merchant Princes Know Chult Best</summary>
        <div>
            <p>5 Kythorn, continued: After a hard fought and rainy battle with the undead scourge, the party repelled them, killing their blue-triangle leader before they could break down the temple door. The priests and the city guard thanked them for their help and rewarded them with tej and a potion of healing. The blue triangle and the undead presence were still somewhat of a mystery. </p>
            <p>6 Kythorn: The party was up bright and early for their two meetings with Ekene-Afa and Wakanga O'tamu.  
                Ekene-Afa told them about the weaponry and gear she sells, including some (pricey) magic items. She also thanked them for their contributions to the city and for knocking her son Tiryk off his high horse (or dino). Motinui also shared some of his past and the negotiations he had with Ekene-Afa to unsuccessfully repel the Flaming Fist threat to his village.  
                Wakanga shared some of his knowledge regarding the undead, including the stories of the warlord Ras Nsi's attack on the now destroyed city of Mezro and the remnants of his undead army. He also spoke of an old town called M'bala on the Aldani Basin that Chiwa had heard of in rumors. Sensing that the party was not necessarily sure of where they were heading in the jungle, he asked them to go investigate the location of a wizard's missing shield construct named Vorn; he said the wizard's journal had been found around 15 years ago, due west of Camp Righteous.</p>
            <p>After their meetings, the party made final preparations for their excursion to Fort Beluarian. They hopped on a ferry, and had a couple hours of travel before they settled in for a peaceful first night.</p>
        </div>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 5: Welcome to the Jungle</summary>
        <div>
            <p>7 Kythorn: The party set out in the sticky jungle heat for proper this time, although their path along the coast was not the dense jungle one initially imagines but more of tall grasses, still fascinating in their biodiversity. In the morning's travel, Rokah noticed a tabaxi lurking in the trees watching them. When the party camped that night, the tabaxi approached sneakily, and gladly accepted an offering of fish. He introduced himself as Thunder in the Morning and warned the party of oncoming undead the way they were travelling, before skulking off into the shadows. </p>
            <p>That evening, on Motinui and Chiwa's watch, a pack of beautiful flying snakes circled the camp. They did not seem hostile, and Chiwa attempted to befriend them with some sort of trick involving a dead mouse heâ€¦ just sort of carries around?... But it didn't seem to work. Later, Hugo and River chatted as fellow tabaxis, and River mentioned a type of lobsterfolk called the Aldani that live in the Aldani basin - this prompted a philosophical discussion on the nature of cannibalism and the ethics of eating sentient beings. </p>
            <p>8 Kythorn: Near the end of the morning's travel, the party passed a beautiful little lake where brontosauruses were grazing on some type of root, including a baby brontosaurus that splashed the party playfully. Awwwww. Shortly afterwards though there was a horde 30 zombies strong, forcing the party to cut their way through thick vines to navigate around them. </p>
            <p>9 Kythorn: As the party neared the end of their travel, they came across a group of lizardfolk who had control of the path forward. They demanded a week's worth of food. Motinui managed to scare them down to 3 days, but negotiations fell apart after a bit of a shouting match. The party killed one of the warriors but the rest, including their shaman leader, escaped. But, the way was open for the party to move forward - after a good nights rest. </p>
        </div>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 6: Meet the Flaming Fist</summary>
        <div>
            <p>10 Kythorn: Waking up to a foggy morning, the party carefully continued on their way to Fort Beluarian when they heard footsteps and carts ahead. A Flaming Fist patrol was coming through, and seeing as the party couldn't get their charter of exploration yet, they were subjected to a patdown search, although Evie hid in the trees and wasn't noticed, and Chiwa was able to discreetly stash some belongings. In addition, Motinui, Dr. Woodward, and Rokah all gave fake names.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Dr. Woodward noticed a subtle path going into the thicker jungle. He and Evie went down it a bit, but vowed to come back later as they didn't want to go too far alone. The party had a quiet night, save for an odd encounter where Chiwa disturbed a horde of ants, and for a second thought he heard cackling laughterâ€¦ </p>
            <p>11 Kythorn: A stormy, windy day. It was a bit difficult to get food due to most game hiding from the storm. The party did come across a bloody fight between a pack of dimetrodons and pteranadons grounded by the wind, but decided to let nature run its course. In the evening, Rokah began to explain what he knew of the Fort and re-outlihed the mission - create a distraction for him to sneak in and find dirt on the commander, Liara Portyr. </p>
            <p>12 Kythorn: The party made it to Fort Beluarian shortly before noon, and began to explore the place. Their first task was purchasing a charter of exploration which was facilitated by the castellan and 2nd in command, Gruta Halsdottir. They also explored the fort to the regular tune of the bell signalling the changing of the watch, during which they schmoozed (Motinui posing as the high class Wake Scalebound) and learned of a jousting tournament happening tomorrow. </p>
            <p>Eventually, Hugo and Evie headed back to camp with Rokah, River, and Flask, when the rest of the party was summoned to the tough-as-nails Liara Portyr, who questioned them about their purpose in Chult. She also offered up a couple jobs - one to simply kill ghouls for 20gp/head, and the other to investigate some large footprints scouts found a couple days south of the Fort. Motinui, Chiwa, and Dr. Woodward got through the conversation surrendering some suspicious vibes, but without any major gaffes. From there, the party headed back to their camp outside the Fort to make final preparations for their plot tomorrow.</p>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 7: Liara Portyr's Sending Stone</summary>
        <div>
            <p>13 Kythorn: After finalizing their plan, the whole party returned to the Fort, not for the jousting tournament, but to talk to Liara Portyr with an invisible Rokah in tow. As Evie chatted up Liara for several minutes, Rokah silently snuck upstairs and swiped an iron strongbox from under Liara's bed. The party then made their way back out with the Flaming Fist essentially none the wiser. When they had escaped from the Fort, the party cracked open the box to find a stash of gold and a mysterious magical stone with a face on one side. Unsure of what it was, Rokah said he would try to get it magically analyzed back in the Port, and our adventurers started heading back to the Port. </p>
            <p>14 Kythorn: An uneventful day of travel. </p>
            <p>15 Kythorn: On their way back, the party stopped at that path Evie and Wallace had gone down earlier to investigate further. There they found a small abandoned village with signs of quick packing. They also found a couple clues: blood on a satchel with some left behind equipment, and a scrap of fabric that looked to be a Flaming Fist insignia. Without any bodies or people around, the mystery was largely left alone for now.</p>
            <p>That night, Rokah heard a message in his head: a gruff Chultan voice demanding an update. Wallace deduced this must be a Sending spell and realized that the stone from earlier must be a Sending Stone. However, it was not clear who was on the other line, and no response was given. </p>
            <p>16-18 Kythorn: Three more peaceful days of travel back toward the fort. </p>
            <p>19 Kythorn: In the night, the party finally made it back to the Port, which had a quiet, almost ominous vibe, with few people on the streets and boarded up buildings. Stopping a stranger moving quickly on his way, they learned that there was a huge tropical storm coming through tomorrow, hence the boarded up buildings, and that the city was a bit on edge due to a mysterious illness that has befallen Merchant Prince Jessamine for a few weeks now. The stranger believed that she had been poisoned by Jobal, and mentioned that similar illness was rumored to have come to high profile figures and adventurers worldwide. The party made their way to Kaya's House of Repose for the night, and puzzled over what to do next. </p>

        <summary>Session 8: The Death Curse</summary>
        <div>
            <p>20 Kythorn: Being woken early by cacophonous thunder, the party experienced their first (not Chiwa's) tropical storm - thunder, sheets of rain, galeforce winds, the lot. They did brave the storm briefly to head to Goldenthrone to schedule an appointment with Wakanga, and they also headed to Rokah's place to check in. His contacts were not able to locate the sending stone's other half, so he handed it off to the party to see if they could convince Wakanga to help out. The party spent the rest of the day in Kaya's House of Repose, chatting with their old acquaintance Salida. </p>
            <p>21 Kythorn: A much clearer day (relatively). At the party's meeting with Wakanga, he offered a deal to locate the sending stone's counterpart as part of the reward for returning the shield guardian Vorn to him. When questioned about Jessamine's state, Wakanga unfortunately couldn't share much, as he was still learning about the Death Curse himself. He directed them to the Temple of Savras, where they met Grandfather Zitembe, the head priest. He performed a ritual for them to try to find the source of the Death Curse and saw a cryptic vision of a city to the south in Chult. </p>
            <p>The party relayed this to Wakanga, who entrusted them with a rare and valuable map of Chult - highly detailed, but mostly unfilled in the center. He also asked them to try to seek out this city and any evidence they might find. Planning out their route, the party decided they would keep River and Flask and head down the Soshenstar to reach Camps Righteous and Vengeance, the last location of Vorn's master, and the Aldani Basin and the mysterious city of M'bala on it. They stocked up on supplies and canoes and prepared to head out the next morning. </p>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 9: Welcome to the Jungle Proper</summary>
        <div>
            <p>22 Kythorn: After a brief chat with Salida in the morning, who wished the party well on their journey, the party set out once again, this time into the jungle proper. Unfortunately, despite only being a few miles out of the Port, River and Flask's arguing combined with some plain old bad luck led the party to miss the head of the River Soshenstar and head down a wrong tributary. The party temporarily headed onto the shore to re-evaluate their position. </p>
            <p>While Evie and Wallace headed into the brush to review their map and orient themselves, they noticed 3 rather large bunny unicorn creatures, later identified as friendly almiraj. The party eventually started heading the right direction (south) once more, keeping a wide birth of a hungry looking turtle. </p>
            <p>The night passed rather uneventfully, except for a false alarm from Chiwa's rather alarming alarm spell. Flask also expressed his frustration with River's forceful persistence, and shared a rumor of an old woman in M'bala who could raise people from the dead in some sort of a merge of undead and humanity. </p>
            <p>23 Kythorn: After a foggy, but rather uneventful day of travel, the party settled down for an evening in an old ruin, identified by Evie as likely an old human residence area. However, in the dead of night, the party was beset by plant-infested, zombified, pale-white dwarves, as well as a pesky yellow flower with an alluring musk that seemed to control the zombies. Eventually dispatching the flower, the zombies became lifeless. The party effectively liquified the zombie corpses, and Motinui decided he would try to smoke the yellow musk creeper, getting fairly high and lightheaded.</p>
