    <p>I currently DM a Tomb of Annihilation campaign for five good friends I met through previous D&D campaigns and have stuck with since. They've been exploring Chult since August 2021 and I've been keeping session logs for every session, unless I forget to. Please enjoy the adventures of Hugo, Evie, Dr. Wallace Woodward, Chiwa, and <span class="strikeout">Motinui</span> <span class="strikeout">Trippin</span> Flump!</p>

        <summary>Session 1: The Party Assembles... Sans One</summary>
        <div>
            <!-- figure TBD -->
            <p>We start our adventure on the fine 2nd day of Kythorn, 1494. A lizardfolk postdoc, Dr. Wallace Woodward; a halfling professor, Dr. Evelyn (Evie) Brightwood; and a tabaxi fisherman, Hugo; have been sailing aboard the Silver Sailor on their way to Chult for about a week now. Led on the water by the gruff Captain Tyrol Quicksilver, our three heroes spend some time getting to know the flamboyant gnome Volo, as well as a half-orc priestess of Torm, Undril Silvertusk. A quiet figure of a Chultan man also lurks, standing more solitary.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, with a splashing sound, the passengers see a purple triton backpedaling towards the boat with a set of four drums. Helping him aboard, they learn his name is Motinui, and he begins to play some Hawaiian-sounding music to raise the spirits of the crew. With Dr. Woodward feeling hungry, Hugo offers to try to catch him some fish, but it is Motinui who is able to get the first bite. However, more bites would be coming soon, as the rest of the party noticed a pack of 5 plesiosauruses fighting over an octopus, 3 of which decided that the party looked tastier.</p>
            <p>Motinui jumped into the water and tried to communicate a sense of danger to the beasts. He successfully deterred one, but the other two were unfazed, and the closer of them took a huge bite out of Motinui, nearly swallowing him in one bite. They eventually repelled the beast, which fled after being badly injured. They were able to finish off the other one and hoist it aboard for its meat, but not before it got a good bite into Hugo, who had also jumped in to protect Motinui.</p>
            <p>The next morning, feeling somewhat rested, the party awoke to a stormier day. Off in the distance, they noticed a ship nearly silhouetted, but that seemed to glimmer just a bit. The ship began to gain on them, and it became clear they flew a black pirate flag….</p>
        </div>

    <details class="session-log">
        <summary>Session 2: Aremag Would Like to Formally Welcome You to Chult</summary>
        <div>
            
            <p>3 Kythorn, continued: As the mysterious pirate ship gained on the Silver Sailor, the heroes began to think of ways to outpace the pirates. In a combination of standard ship work, inspiring performance, prayer to Umberlee, and a successful shot through the pirate's sail, the crew managed to steer themselves to clearer water and convince their adversaries they weren't worth the trouble. The Chultan man commended the party for their work and introduced himself as Rokah, suggesting that they seemed capable and he might have a job for them in the port. Captain Quicksilver informed the ship they should arrive the next day.</p>
            <p>4 Kythorn: After a dry and uneventful morning, as the ship grew closer and closer to Chult, out of nowhere Aremag the Dragon Turtle rose from the deep and DEMANDED TRIBUTE! Strapped for cash and with everyone but Rokah being caught unaware, Aremag grew impatient, slapping the ship with his tail, sending Hugo, Motinui, Captain Quicksilver, and much of the crew overboard into shark infested waters. All but one of the crew managed to clamber ashore, while those still on board looked suspiciously at Volo, who falsely claimed he didn't have much money with him. Motinui snatched his coin purse, and looking foolish, went to go get some more cash while Evie followed behind to ensure he didn't do anything stupid. While Volo went up with more gems, Evie also snagged a copy of Volo's Guide to Monsters. Finally appeased, Aremag slunk into the water.</p>

            <p>Finally, in the afternoon, the party arrived at Port Nyanzaru, witnessing the fragrant smells, beautiful people and art, and of course the dinosaurs. There they met Chiwa, a Chultan street urchin no older than 15 or 16 who offered himself as a city guide in exchange for food and lodgings. They arranged appointments to meet with Ekene-Afa and Wakanga O'tamu within a couple of days, and seeked out Rokah for more details on getting work. He told them he needed an escort to Fort Beluarian, and to create a distraction so he could tie the Flaming Fist to the pirates that had plagued them the day before. He also introduced them to River Mist and Flask of Wine, who suggested they gear up for travel. </p>
            <p>5 Kythorn: After a relaxing rest in Kaya's House of Repose, the party went for a bit of shopping and prepared to go to the dinosaur races later that day in an attempt to win some money.</p>

        <summary>Session 3: The Dinosaur Race</summary>
        <div>
            
            <p>5 Kythorn, continued: The party made their way to Tiryki Anchorage, where Motinui scanned the dinosaurs for a worthy ride. He quickly bonded with Nasty Boy, a young allosaurus, and chose him as his trusty steed for the race. After everyone placed some bets, the dinosaur races were off, pitting the newcomer Motinui against Ortimay Swift and Dark, Faroul and Gondolo, Salida, and the crowd favorite Tiryk. Despite an aggressive start slowing Nasty Boy due to exhaustion right out the gates, luck and skill conspired in Motinui's favor, and he managed to win the race, earning himself cash, an invitation to dine with a merchant prince of his choice, and the key to Port Nyanzaru. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>After the race, with his new earnings, Motinui struck a deal to purchase Nasty Boy from his trainer in exchange for a down payment and 25% of his future winnings. The whole party then went to the Thundering Lizard, where they celebrated with tej and greasy pub food. While there, Chiwa overheard a tall tale of a ghost town looking over the Aldani Basin. As the night partied on, suddenly horns and bells started ringing through the city. The party went to investigate and discovered the city was under attack by undead once again, and the Temple of Tymora was in danger. Offering to lend a helping hand, they found themselves face to face with a small horde of zombies and skeletons, led by an undead figure with an ominous blue triangle on its forehead.</p>

        <summary>Session 4: The Merchant Princes Know Chult Best</summary>
        <div>
            <p>5 Kythorn, continued: After a hard fought and rainy battle with the undead scourge, the party repelled them, killing their blue-triangle leader before they could break down the temple door. The priests and the city guard thanked them for their help and rewarded them with tej and a potion of healing. The blue triangle and the undead presence were still somewhat of a mystery. </p>
            <p>6 Kythorn: The party was up bright and early for their two meetings with Ekene-Afa and Wakanga O'tamu.

                </figure>
            </div>
            <p>Ekene-Afa told them about the weaponry and gear she sells, including some (pricey) magic items. She also thanked them for their contributions to the city and for knocking her son Tiryk off his high horse (or dino). Motinui also shared some of his past and the negotiations he had with Ekene-Afa to unsuccessfully repel the Flaming Fist threat to his village.  </p>
            <p>Wakanga shared some of his knowledge regarding the undead, including the stories of the warlord Ras Nsi's attack on the now destroyed city of Mezro and the remnants of his undead army. He also spoke of an old town called M'bala on the Aldani Basin that Chiwa had heard of in rumors. Sensing that the party was not necessarily sure of where they were heading in the jungle, he asked them to go investigate the location of a wizard's missing shield construct named Vorn; he said the wizard's journal had been found around 15 years ago, due west of Camp Righteous.</p>
            <p>After their meetings, the party made final preparations for their excursion to Fort Beluarian. They hopped on a ferry, and had a couple hours of travel before they settled in for a peaceful first night.</p>

        <summary>Session 5: Welcome to the Jungle</summary>

                <img src="img/DND/ToA/Jungles of Chult.jpg" alt="A party looks out at waterfalls flowing into a ravine">
            </figure>
            <p>7 Kythorn: The party set out in the sticky jungle heat for proper this time, although their path along the coast was not the dense jungle one initially imagines but more of tall grasses, still fascinating in their biodiversity. In the morning's travel, Rokah noticed a tabaxi lurking in the trees watching them. When the party camped that night, the tabaxi approached sneakily, and gladly accepted an offering of fish. He introduced himself as Thunder in the Morning and warned the party of oncoming undead the way they were travelling, before skulking off into the shadows. </p>
            <p>That evening, on Motinui and Chiwa's watch, a pack of beautiful flying snakes circled the camp. They did not seem hostile, and Chiwa attempted to befriend them with some sort of trick involving a dead mouse he… just sort of carries around?... But it didn't seem to work. Later, Hugo and River chatted as fellow tabaxis, and River mentioned a type of lobsterfolk called the Aldani that live in the Aldani basin - this prompted a philosophical discussion on the nature of cannibalism and the ethics of eating sentient beings. </p>
            <p>8 Kythorn: Near the end of the morning's travel, the party passed a beautiful little lake where brontosauruses were grazing on some type of root, including a baby brontosaurus that splashed the party playfully. Awwwww. Shortly afterwards though there was a horde 30 zombies strong, forcing the party to cut their way through thick vines to navigate around them. </p>
            <p>9 Kythorn: As the party neared the end of their travel, they came across a group of lizardfolk who had control of the path forward. They demanded a week's worth of food. Motinui managed to scare them down to 3 days, but negotiations fell apart after a bit of a shouting match. The party killed one of the warriors but the rest, including their shaman leader, escaped. But, the way was open for the party to move forward - after a good nights rest. </p>

        <summary>Session 6: Meet the Flaming Fist</summary>
        <div>
            <p>10 Kythorn: Waking up to a foggy morning, the party carefully continued on their way to Fort Beluarian when they heard footsteps and carts ahead. A Flaming Fist patrol was coming through, and seeing as the party couldn't get their charter of exploration yet, they were subjected to a patdown search, although Evie hid in the trees and wasn't noticed, and Chiwa was able to discreetly stash some belongings. In addition, Motinui, Dr. Woodward, and Rokah all gave fake names.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Dr. Woodward noticed a subtle path going into the thicker jungle. He and Evie went down it a bit, but vowed to come back later as they didn't want to go too far alone. The party had a quiet night, save for an odd encounter where Chiwa disturbed a horde of ants, and for a second thought he heard cackling laughter… </p>
            <p>11 Kythorn: A stormy, windy day. It was a bit difficult to get food due to most game hiding from the storm. The party did come across a bloody fight between a pack of dimetrodons and pteranadons grounded by the wind, but decided to let nature run its course. In the evening, Rokah began to explain what he knew of the Fort and re-outlihed the mission - create a distraction for him to sneak in and find dirt on the commander, Liara Portyr. </p>
            <p>12 Kythorn: The party made it to Fort Beluarian shortly before noon, and began to explore the place. Their first task was purchasing a charter of exploration which was facilitated by the castellan and 2nd in command, Gruta Halsdottir. They also explored the fort to the regular tune of the bell signalling the changing of the watch, during which they schmoozed (Motinui posing as the high class Wake Scalebound) and learned of a jousting tournament happening tomorrow. </p>
            <p>Eventually, Hugo and Evie headed back to camp with Rokah, River, and Flask, when the rest of the party was summoned to the tough-as-nails Liara Portyr, who questioned them about their purpose in Chult. She also offered up a couple jobs - one to simply kill ghouls for 20gp/head, and the other to investigate some large footprints scouts found a couple days south of the Fort. Motinui, Chiwa, and Dr. Woodward got through the conversation surrendering some suspicious vibes, but without any major gaffes. From there, the party headed back to their camp outside the Fort to make final preparations for their plot tomorrow.</p>

        <summary>Session 7: Liara Portyr's Sending Stone</summary>
        <div>
            <p>13 Kythorn: After finalizing their plan, the whole party returned to the Fort, not for the jousting tournament, but to talk to Liara Portyr with an invisible Rokah in tow. As Evie chatted up Liara for several minutes, Rokah silently snuck upstairs and swiped an iron strongbox from under Liara's bed. The party then made their way back out with the Flaming Fist essentially none the wiser. When they had escaped from the Fort, the party cracked open the box to find a stash of gold and a mysterious magical stone with a face on one side. Unsure of what it was, Rokah said he would try to get it magically analyzed back in the Port, and our adventurers started heading back to the Port. </p>
            <p>14 Kythorn: An uneventful day of travel. </p>
            <p>15 Kythorn: On their way back, the party stopped at that path Evie and Wallace had gone down earlier to investigate further. There they found a small abandoned village with signs of quick packing. They also found a couple clues: blood on a satchel with some left behind equipment, and a scrap of fabric that looked to be a Flaming Fist insignia. Without any bodies or people around, the mystery was largely left alone for now.</p>
            <p>That night, Rokah heard a message in his head: a gruff Chultan voice demanding an update. Wallace deduced this must be a Sending spell and realized that the stone from earlier must be a Sending Stone. However, it was not clear who was on the other line, and no response was given. </p>

            </figure>
            <p>16-18 Kythorn: Three more peaceful days of travel back toward the fort. </p>
            <p>19 Kythorn: In the night, the party finally made it back to the Port, which had a quiet, almost ominous vibe, with few people on the streets and boarded up buildings. Stopping a stranger moving quickly on his way, they learned that there was a huge tropical storm coming through tomorrow, hence the boarded up buildings, and that the city was a bit on edge due to a mysterious illness that has befallen Merchant Prince Jessamine for a few weeks now. The stranger believed that she had been poisoned by Jobal, and mentioned that similar illness was rumored to have come to high profile figures and adventurers worldwide. The party made their way to Kaya's House of Repose for the night, and puzzled over what to do next. </p>

        <summary>Session 8: The Death Curse</summary>
        <div>
            <!-- storm or smth? -->
            <p>20 Kythorn: Being woken early by cacophonous thunder, the party experienced their first (not Chiwa's) tropical storm - thunder, sheets of rain, galeforce winds, the lot. They did brave the storm briefly to head to Goldenthrone to schedule an appointment with Wakanga, and they also headed to Rokah's place to check in. His contacts were not able to locate the sending stone's other half, so he handed it off to the party to see if they could convince Wakanga to help out. The party spent the rest of the day in Kaya's House of Repose, chatting with their old acquaintance Salida. </p>
            <p>21 Kythorn: A much clearer day (relatively). At the party's meeting with Wakanga, he offered a deal to locate the sending stone's counterpart as part of the reward for returning the shield guardian Vorn to him. When questioned about Jessamine's state, Wakanga unfortunately couldn't share much, as he was still learning about the Death Curse himself. He directed them to the Temple of Savras, where they met Grandfather Zitembe, the head priest. He performed a ritual for them to try to find the source of the Death Curse and saw a cryptic vision of a city to the south in Chult. </p>
            <p>The party relayed this to Wakanga, who entrusted them with a rare and valuable map of Chult - highly detailed, but mostly unfilled in the center. He also asked them to try to seek out this city and any evidence they might find. Planning out their route, the party decided they would keep River and Flask and head down the Soshenstar to reach Camps Righteous and Vengeance, the last location of Vorn's master, and the Aldani Basin and the mysterious city of M'bala on it. They stocked up on supplies and canoes and prepared to head out the next morning. </p>

        <summary>Session 9: Welcome to the Jungle Proper</summary>
        <div>
            <p>22 Kythorn: After a brief chat with Salida in the morning, who wished the party well on their journey, the party set out once again, this time into the jungle proper. Unfortunately, despite only being a few miles out of the Port, River and Flask's arguing combined with some plain old bad luck led the party to miss the head of the River Soshenstar and head down a wrong tributary. The party temporarily headed onto the shore to re-evaluate their position. </p>
            <p>While Evie and Wallace headed into the brush to review their map and orient themselves, they noticed 3 rather large bunny unicorn creatures, later identified as friendly almiraj. The party eventually started heading the right direction (south) once more, keeping a wide birth of a hungry looking turtle. </p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>The night passed rather uneventfully, except for a false alarm from Chiwa's rather alarming alarm spell. Flask also expressed his frustration with River's forceful persistence, and shared a rumor of an old woman in M'bala who could raise people from the dead in some sort of a merge of undead and humanity. </p>
            <p>23 Kythorn: After a foggy, but rather uneventful day of travel, the party settled down for an evening in an old ruin, identified by Evie as likely an old human residence area. However, in the dead of night, the party was beset by plant-infested, zombified, pale-white dwarves, as well as a pesky yellow flower with an alluring musk that seemed to control the zombies. Eventually dispatching the flower, the zombies became lifeless. The party effectively liquified the zombie corpses, and Motinui decided he would try to smoke the yellow musk creeper, getting fairly high and lightheaded.</p>

        <summary>Session 10: A Bizarre Statue Lets Them In; An Ancient Shrine Keeps Them Out</summary>
        <div>
            <!-- camp righteous hopefully -->
            <p>24 Kythorn: Waking up to heavy wind, the party made the decision to wait until the afternoon to travel in hopes that the weather would get better. That gamble paid off, and they set off that afternoon, where they met a small band of Emerald Enclave scouts who had found a strange statue head that was talking. One of the scouts, Christine, brought the party to the statue, which introduced itself as Kukailimokukanaloalonokanehoalani, a name which appeared to be an amalgamation of many ancient tribal Chultan gods' names. When the party approached with caution and respect, praising its might, it allowed them one treasure from within it, and Motinui took a mysterious brass bottle. After that, the party continued on their way, unsure of what the statue was or how/why it came to be there.</p>
            <p>25 Kythorn: The party's travel down the Soshenstar continued. They had to briefly duck out of the river to avoid a patch of blue mad monkey mist, which was causing some crocodiles in the river to behave erratically. </p>
            <p>26 Kythorn: A fairly quiet day of travel. The main thing of note was a strange green blob that arced through the air way in the distance, but it was unclear what exactly it was. A mystery for another day perhaps.</p>
            <p>27 Kythorn: Today, the party was beset by the Flaming Fist once again. Fortunately, they did not seem to have gotten word that of the party's deeds in Fort Beluarian. However, there was nearly a problem, as River and Flask were not listed on the register of jungle guides. They managed to slip away with some clever deceit and with a thick pamphlet of paperwork to finish.</p>
            <p>28 Kythorn: At long last, the party came across the abandoned Camp Righteous. There stood the remnants of the Order of the Gauntlet's camp, as well as the imposing structure memorializing the tale of Man and Crocodile. While there, they released a fledgling axe beak, which Motinui tried unsuccessfully to befriend; scanned the old camp, finding only a forgotten holy symbol and a lone corpse rotting in a latrine; and searched through the beginning of the tunnel into the statue, triggering traps galore and badly injuring Wallace and Chiwa. They decided this mystery too would be for another day when they are stronger, and decided to continue on their way to the last known location of Vorn's master. </p>

            <p>29 Kythorn: Continuing down the river for another day past Camp Righteous, the party fended off some hungry crocodiles in the fog before hiding their canoes in the jungle brush and setting out on foot into the jungle proper. That evening, as Chiwa and River kept watch, Chiwa noticed a crowd of grung had surrounded the camp in the trees and were pulling out daggers to throw. He woke the party up and a vicious battle ensued with Hugo taking some tough hits especially, but eventually the grung were all defeated, leaving no survivors to escape. The party settled back down for the evening to lick their wounds.</p>
            <p>30 Kythorn: With a bit of energy back after a grueling midnight fight, the party continued on their way to Vorn's last location. While setting up camp, Evie noticed some camouflaged figures wearing ant masks (later identified as goblins) watching them. The party called out to the stalking creatures, who slowly retreated into the jungle. Evie and Wallace tried to follow them, but couldn’t find their tracks in the fog.</p>
            <p>1 Flamerule: That morning, Flask and some of the rest of the party noticed grung tracks headed the same direction they were, and sure enough, after several hours they came across a bit of a scene. They saw the inert statue of Vorn in the center of a clearing, being prayed to by some grung (apparently the same tribe that had ambushed them earlier) and some strange plant figures on plant dogs. Various offerings surrounded the statue, and a pair of masked goblins were walking off. Motinui spontaneously cast sleep on the goblins, knocking them out, and giving the party plenty of time to surround their sleeping forms while the grung and plant creatures watched in concern. The goblins, named Bog and Glog, promised they didn't know anything about the goblins who watched the party earlier, and were allowed to leave and go back home after revealing that the statue was very sacred (although they didn't have a name for it). The party investigated the scene for the control amulet, but found no sources of magic besides Vorn itself thus far, and they puzzled over where to go next.</p>

        <div>
            <p>1 Flamerule, continued: Still puzzling over where they could find the amulet, Wallace attempted to communicate with the grung before they left. The grung seemed to imply there was some sort of goblin civilization to the northeast and their grung settlement was to the south. However, the party decided to start heading northwest to try to get closer to the exact location that Vorn was marked on the map.</p>
            <p>That evening, the full moon rose, and the party was beset by a vicious wereboar! It came out the gates kicking, knocking Wallace unconscious just as he was standing up from waking up. The wereboar's unnaturally thick hide proved to be a serious obstacle, as the party's many nonmagical attacks proved futile, but eventually, the party's strength in numbers overtook the brute's raw strength, and they took down the wereboar as it tried to escape, which turned back into the Chultan woman she once was.</p>
            <p>2 Flamerule: A dry and windy day, the party made their way northwest, unfortunately not finding much along the way. There was a small elemental called a chwinga that tried to rifle through Chiwa's bags, but Wallace caught it with a quick grab, and when they released it, it disappeared after jumping onto a rock. The evening passed uneventfully, but the party seemed no closer to finding the amulet's location.</p>

        <div>
            <!-- proper art of sewn sisters? -->
            <p>3 Flamerule: Awakening to a fairly rainy jungle morning, the party started heading to where they hoped the goblins would be when they found an unsettling sight: A tabaxi woman tied to a tree, covered in honey and crawling with ants, with a leather sack over her head and with two gold coins stuck to it as eyes. Freeing her, she introduced herself as Ringing Bells, an adventurer from the Company of the Yellow Banner who was separated during a T rex attack. She was then captured by goblins and tied up, supposedly for entertainment. She asked to move with the party for the rest of the day.</p>
            <p>In the evening, as Ringing Bells took watch with Evie, Evie started to zone out when she heard a muttering and fell soundly asleep.</p>
            <p>The five party members all awoke in a dream from their past: A young Evie at a dig site; Motinui by a coral reef outside his village; Hugo outside Daelin's shop by the sea; Wallace taking respite from his family in the library; and Chiwa by an underground river with the smell of blood and sibilant chanting in the distance, playing with the skull he uses. They all eventually noticed an archway in their dream, and entered it out of curiosity, or in Chiwa's case, out of necessity as the world started to crumble around him.</p>
            <p>The party then all arrived into a round entrance chamber, with stone walls that occasionally flickered with old memories and that extended up and faded into a starry, cloudy void. Three starry pathways, one red, blue, and yellow, headed into the unknown.</p>
            <p>Following the blue path, the party came into a square room with pedestals and alcoves, each with a leather bag on it. A mysterious face loomed from above, cackling. As the party began to open bags, finding only marbles, children's teeth, and poisonous gas, the woman watching from above began to stomp down with her peg leg. This continued for some time as the party puzzled over how to escape, getting nowhere. Eventually, Evie threw a bag of marbles at the woman in frustration, which didn't do much, but as she continued stomping, she slipped on the marbles and fell back leaving a ring of keys behind as a new pathway opened.</p>
            <p>Entering a new room with just yellow and red paths and 3 pedestals in it, the party went down the yellow path into a room with 2 large anthills and a skull on a shelf, as a disembodied voice began to taunt the party. As larger and larger ants began to pour out of the anthills, Hugo realized that there might be something else in the anthills. Sure enough, inside each anthill was a single gold coin. Placing those coins in the eye sockets of the skulls, the skull and shelf and ants all dissolved into slime, allowing passage back into the pedestal room.</p>
            <p>The final path after the red path lead to a room with 3 cages, each containing a squirming leather sack. A high pitched voice introduced them as her pets: a cockatrice, a large snake, and a fiery dog, all of which bursted out of the bags and the cages to attack! The cockatrice gave a bit of a petrification scare but was quickly dealt with, the snake was somehow befriended by Chiwa (and later brutally betrayed), and the dog dealt some serious damage before falling. As each died, they dissolved, leaving behind a feather, fang, and tooth respectively, and the passage back to the pedestal room opened again. Placing the children's teeth, gold coins, and animal parts on the pedestals, a fourth door opened onto a black path.</p>
            <p>Following the final path, the party landed in a large chamber with various supplies scattered on the tables, including a cryptic rhyme in another language and 5 pedestals with different metal locks. Eventually, each party member inserted a key into a lock, as the wall dissolved revealing 5 tables with restraints and a crucible of boiling metal over each. The party began to feel sleepy as 3 figures entered the room and led them each to a table: 1 with a peg leg and yellow gas coming from her mouth; 1 crawling with ants and with 2 gold coins for eyes; and 1 with a squirming sack over her head, out of which poked feathers, scales, and fur. As each member was strapped to a table, each head over a geometrically shaped mold, the crucibles were tilted as the party's vision went bright, then dark.</p>
            <p>4 Flamerule: The party awoke, unharmed (although River and Flask had been bound), with Ringing Bells nowhere to be seen. All 5 of the party had a small pinprick on their wrist, indicative of drawing blood or injecting something into the bloodstream. The party puzzled over the events that had transpired as the memories of their shared dreams began to fade.</p>

        <div>
            <p>4 Flamerule, continued: Moving on from the confusing events of the previous night, the party endured a day of foggy travel to the northeast. They realized they had likely gone too far north, and decided they would head due south the next day. The night passed uneventfully, although the dark fog encroaching on the camp creeped most of the party out, making them even a little suspicious of their mysterious companion Chiwa, who likes this sort of stuff.</p>
            <p>5 Flamerule: On an unseasonably nice day, the party began to head south to where they believed the goblin camp was. Shortly after setting out, they found a mysterious sonnet written in Primordial telling of an old city called Orolunga to the southeast in the Mistcliff Mountains. They decided to stay focused on the goblins and Vorn and stash the poem away for later, perhaps.</p>
            <p>A couple hours later, they began noticing signs of civilization - skulls on pikes, alarm tripwires, and a few scouts rustling away from them. Wallace tried to call out to them and convince them they were friendly, and they turned for a moment before continuing to retreat further south. The party, purposefully making their presence obvious to the goblins, came upon their camp - a small community of perhaps 40 goblins, young and old, with a few huts and some ant hills. Really of note though was that the whole village was essentially a trebuchet - the main village was set up on a thick net of leaves and moss, tied to a bent over tree and suspended with ropes such that when the ropes were cut, the tree would fling itself back up and the village would go flying. The goblins ordered the party to meet with their leader, Queen Grabstab, and Motinui served as the party spokesman, noticing a very familiar amulet on her neck - Vorn's control amulet.</p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As Motinui attempted to parlay with Grabstab, who told them to pass on by and not disturb them, the rest of the party outside began to hear heavy thumping from the north, and it wasn't long before an enormous, fearsome tyrannosaurus rex emerged from the brush, ready to attack! Chaos ensued. The goblins began to run in all directions out of the village while Grabstab started to give orders in Goblin. In the thick of it, Motinui turned invisible and snatched the amulet off Grabstab's neck without her noticing, while the other party members jumped into trees, ran, and attempted to fight the tyrant of the jungle. Wallace came up with a brave plan to goad the t. rex into the net, then jump away at the last moment as the mechanism was released and the dino went flying with the village. This didn't go exactly as planned, as the t. rex ended up half on, half off the net, and Wallace was nearly made into a one bite snack, but Motinui's insults distracted the beast for one crucial moment. A couple of the goblins then attempted to cut the vines, but couldn't finish the job, so it was up to Chiwa to make the crucial decision to shoot at the vines with an Eldritch Blast, splitting the vines. It was anyone's guess as to whether the t. rex would be caught in the net, but by an extremely fortunate stroke of luck, the t. rex just barely lost balance, and soared through the sky to the southeast along with most of the goblin village. The party then absconded before the chaos wore off and Grabstab realized what she was missing.</p>
            <p>The party then decided to move slowly for a bit to ensure they were not being followed by the goblins and to cover their tracks. They did so fairly successfully, landing themselves in an unwelcoming marsh for the evening, where they decompressed for a bit.</p>
            <p>6 Flamerule: The party returned to Vorn's site, and Motinui, with Vorn's amulet around his neck, ordered Vorn to awaken, which he did! The plant-like creatures who were at the site seemed to take great offense, but Vorn and the party made quick work of both of the smaller figures and one of the plant-like dogs, the other one escaping. The party was then left with a brand new companion, and a taste of success.</p>

        <div>
            <p>6 Flamerule, continued: With Vorn in tow, the party traveled for about an hour more after pondering the value of their new friend - perhaps quite valuable. Vorn watched over them as they slept through a bit of a storm.</p>
            <p>7 Flamerule: A new day. The party decided they'd head back towards their canoes to try to head down to Camp Vengeance, although they later realized their new clunky friend would probably make canoeing impossible, as well as stealthing - the large robot proved not so subtle. In the afternoon, they found some delicious looking creatures known as zorbos that attacked when Wallace began to engage with them. A few scratches later, they were vanquished and eaten, and the party managed to avoid the lasting damage to their armor that zorbos are known to cause. They also picked up some wukka nuts, useful for light in a pinch.</p>
            <p>8 Flamerule: Early in the morning as the dawn rose and Wallace kept watch, two figures rushed through the trees into camp: one human, and one reptilian creature later recognized as a saurial, a very rare alien creature vaguely related to a dinosaur. The human, Artus Cimber, urged the party to hide, citing the presence of Red Wizards of Thay, while the saurial, Dragonbait, gave off various strange scents in lieu of speech. After hiding for about 20 minutes safely, the two parties conversed a bit. Artus mentioned that he was being sought after by various groups but was notably cagey as to why, claiming "it's better that you don't know." He did provide a bit more information as to the undead's source - Ras Nsi's undead army against Mezro - but didn't know much about the Death Curse. He then said he was searching for Orolunga to get some unspecified knowledge, and thanked the party for sharing the poem they had found a few days earlier with him. Then, they went off.</p>

            <p>The rest of the day passed fairly uneventfully, although in the evening Wallace made the troubling discovery of thick hair starting to grow under his scales.</p>
            <p>9 Flamerule: The party arrived at Camp Vengeance past noon, and it seemed to not be in the best shape. Sick troops, moldy tents, festering pools, and decaying carcasses were everywhere, as the Order of the Gauntlet seemingly struggled to keep things going deep in the jungle. The party earned the good grace of one of the camp's captains, Perne Salhana, and the head priest of the camp, Sister Cyas, as well as reunited with their old shipmate Undril Silvertusk. They provided much magical assistance to the camp by curing some of the diseases the camp's men had come down with. Meanwhile, Undril diagnosed Wallace with what he had worried he might have - lycanthropy - after he felt uncomfortable holding a silver coin. Hugo tried to convince the priests to spend some time removing Wallace's curse, but they seemed hesitant to divert any power away from keeping the most ill alive. The party thought about the best way to help out the camp and also get some of what they were looking for - namely, a curse removed and perhaps a bit of cash for all their efforts too.</p>

        <div>
            <!-- undead siege pic, or girallon/zombie clot split-->
            <p>9 Flamerule, continued: The party, deciding to help the beleaguered forces of Camp Vengeance, all set out to work on various tasks - repairing the tents, clearing the ditch of corpses and refuse, and tending to the wounded. However, trouble was approaching, as foreshadowed by a sense of the undead in the jungle that Evie felt and a stressed conversation Wallace picked up parts of from the command tent. Soon, the commander Niles Breakbone emerged and gathered up the camp to warn them of a big undead attack numbering in the hundreds to arrive by nightfall. Ordering the party not to go running off, he told everyone to prepare themselves.</p>
            <p>As nightfall approached, the camp readied themselves, with everyone on duty. The party's ranged attackers positioned themselves on the watchtowers with the camp's forces, and a defensive perimeter inside the walls readied themselves to hold off intruders. Soon, with the half moon overhead, the undead began to shamble out - clusters of zombies, ghouls, and ghasts encroaching upon the camp. At first, things seemed to be under control - the zombies were generally easy to stop and although the ghouls and ghasts were resilient, the walls seemed to keep them at bay.</p>
            <p>However, only a short time after, the second wave arrived - more zombies, and the hulking forms of ogre zombies, huge ankylosaur zombies, and terrifying 4-armed primate zombies approached. The primates were shockingly fast, and worse, could climb the walls, allowing them to come in and make quick work of the camp's foot soldiers with their flurries of blows. They were eventually dispatched (not without serious casualties), but the rest of the forces came ever closer.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the first sections of the walls finally gave way, and the forces on the ground tried desperately to keep the undead at bay. However, just as the ankylosaur zombies reached the walls, a demoralizing 3rd and final wave approached - zombies, some of which looked diseased; some pale figures with troubling ranged attacks; and 2 hulking monstrosities that looked to be amalgams of corpses combined into one entity. However, the 3rd attack was barely necessary - the ankylosaurs made short work of the walls, and the camp was about to be overrun. Wallace and many others urged Commander Breakbone to call for retreat as the rest of the party started their escape early (lead by Hugo), but he adamantly refused. Soon though, the chaos was too great, and with Breakbone's bones broken by an ankylosaur tail sweep, the gate was opened, and everyone ran for their lives. While the party escaped mostly unscathed, the loss for the Order of the Gauntlet was severe. Only fifteen of nearly sixty people survived, with Perne and Undril the ranking officers amongst them. Both groups stumbled away from a devastating defeat wondering what on earth they could do now….</p>

        <div>
            <p>9 Flamerule, continued: Reeling from their defeat, the party decided to run through the night to get as much distance as possible on the undead. Although questions ran through their mind - what caused the undead to do this, chief among them - there was no time to think, as they ran north while the sun rose.</p>
            <p>10 Flamerule: Exhausted, the party managed to settle down for a full 24 hours to recover.</p>
            <p>11-15 Flamerule: The party continued to travel back up the Soshenstar en route to Port Nyanzaru, racing the moon to get there before Wallace transformed at Midsummer's full moon. Their first setback was an unfortunate foggy misdirection, causing them to go south instead of northeast and effectively losing them 2 days. However, they got back on track and waved to Camp Righteous, still not ready to try their hands at conquering the shrine.</p>
            <p>16 Flamerule: CRACK! BOOM! A torrent of rain and gusts awoke the party to another tropical storm. Thoroughly soaked and with no proper shelter in sight, the party hunkered down and generally were miserable. </p>
            <p>In the night, as Chiwa and Wallace peered through the darkness and the rain for potential danger, it found them: 4 yuan-ti, 3 purebloods and 1 malison, emerged from behind them. The purebloods all attempted to convince Wallace to go back to sleep with their magical silver tongues, but he resisted their efforts and screamed to wake everyone else. However, all hell broke loose when Chiwa himself tried to magically stand Wallace down and hear what the intruders had to say.</p>
            <p>Chaos ensued. Wallace aimed his slingshot at Chiwa, who was held onto by Vorn on Motinui's command. Evie tried to stand between Chiwa and Wallace to break them up, while Hugo's divinely glowing hammer was pointed at Wallace. A few shots were fired at the yuan-ti, who retreated and spoke to Chiwa under the name Sehauxan, asking him to speak with them when he was less preoccupied. Chiwa admitted he recognized the leader, the malison Shoztessah, from his past and that his name with them had been Sehuaxan. He told them he had taken the skull he used to channel his magic from them. However, he largely squirmed around other direct answers. The party lowered from their Mexican standoff, with most of the party (Wallace in particular) frustratedly going back to bed in the miserable storm. However, Evie went with Chiwa to keep him safe while Chiwa had a private conversation via message with Shoztessah. Evie asked directly the question on everyone's mind - are you a yuan-ti? - and while Chiwa again didn't fully answer, Evie knew he was still hiding something important. Everyone went to bed, as part of a more fractured, confused party. Who exactly was this orphan kid from the streets of Port Nyanzaru?</p>

            <p>23 Flamerule: Another day of travel, but as they waded along in the river on their canoes they saw the unwelcome sight of a posse of Flaming Fist blocking the river ahead. Immediately hiding Vorn with invisibility to prevent the Flaming Fist from seeing and presumably seizing him, the party eventually was hailed over. Unfortunately for them, word of their deeds at Fort Beluarian had finally made their way through the ranks, and they were placed under arrest for a litany of charges. But, the party would not go down without a fight - as the chief officer attempted to read them their rights, it was clear that they would not go peacefully and combat began. </p>

            <p>23 Flamerule, continued: Combat broke out between the party and the Flaming Fist as had seemed destined, but the party's superior might and reflexes proved an easy victory. After killing all the commanding officers and chasing down a couple of fleeing soldiers to prevent word of their crime from spreading, only one Fist remained, tied up in his canoe. Through all this, Motinui started acting strangely sadistic, even gruesomely cutting off the face of one of the soldiers and wearing it as a crude mask to intimidate their prisoner. They attempted to interrogate the soldier, named Private Corporal, but due to his rank he didn’t seem to know much of use - they had better luck combing through the Sergeant's papers, finding the details of the crimes they were charged with and some more information on the mysterious bootprints south of Fort Beluarian. Motinui agreed to allow their prisoner to leave in exchange for total silence on what had happened that day, and the soldier seemed very willing to cooperate, but Chiwa ensured that he would by killing him with a virulent spell before he could be released. The party then fled from the grisly scene.</p>
            <p>24-29 Flamerule: The party continued on their way back to the Port, discussing amongst themselves the other members of their party and questioning what came next. Wallace approached Chiwa, making a working relationship but assuring that any harm he caused the party would result in death. Motinui suggested to Hugo that they kill River and Flask so as not to have to split the reward from Vorn, a suggestion that Hugo refuted and then informed the rest of the party about (sans River and Flask themselves). The moon grew ever fuller.</p>
            <p>30 Flamerule: Finally arriving in the Port amid mist and rain, the party discussed what their first order of business was, deciding that the best choice was to head to Wakanga first for the reward, then go get Wallace cured. However, they had to take a quick diversion to find Motinui, who had slipped away while they were discussing and had headed to the dinosaur pens to pick up Nasty Boy. He would find himself short on cash anyway, so the party headed to Goldenthrone. Wakanga then took them to his personal villa, where in exchange for the amulet, Wakanga provided 3500 gold, split 7 ways, and a discount on his wares. He also pointed out the location of the other sending stone on the map as a point on the shore of Jahaka Bay. Hearing the news of Camp Vengeance's fall, he returned to Goldenthrone to work and the party was escorted out.</p>
            <p>While Motinui headed off on his own to purchase Nasty Boy in full and hype up his return to the dinosaur races for Midsummer, the rest of the party toured the many temples of the Port in search of a cleric with remove curse available. There were none, but Priest Zarolo of Tymora agreed to prepare it for first thing next morning at a discount for having helped his temple earlier. The party however did get a chance to visit all the temples and see their preparations for Midsummer - the Temple of Tymora was rehearsing a play, the Temple of Gond was preparing carnival games, and the Temple of Sune cleaned them up from their disgusting jungle travels (except Chiwa, who refused) - and meet or reconnect with Savras's Grandfather Zitembe and Mother Sibonseni of the Hall of Gold. They also shared the solemn news of Camp Vengeance with the assorted clergy. Exhausted from over a month in the jungle, they returned to Kaya's House of Repose to rest, where Evie received a long-awaited letter back from home.</p>

Not sure of what was going on but not seeing Motinui among them, the party make a reasonable deduction that he had gotten himself into trouble and agreed (without much other option) to come in for questioning. Each of them was questioned 1 by 1 under a zone of truth, but they managed to avoid telling the guards the worst of Motinui's outbreaks. Eventually let go, the party returned to bed, dreading what news they'd hear the next morning.</p>
            <p>They awoke for the morning a few hours later and rushed to the Temple of Tymora where Wallace's curse was ended not a day too soon, and as they returned they heard the news from the town crier: Motinui had been arrested after trying to break into Goldenthrone and assaulting a guard. The trial was that day and, assuming a guilty verdict, Executioner's Run the next day. The party discussed what to do, eventually deciding to allow the trial to go on as normal but potentially trying to aid Motinui in the Run the next day. They enjoyed the Midsummer festivities - the Merchant Prince dunk tank, the carnival games, and the feasts.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Motinui's trial was in session. The guard who he had attacked testified against him, seemingly damning his case. However, something very interesting happened: under oath of zone of truth, Motinui testified that he couldn't remember large swaths of the past week or so, including the night of the attack. Perplexed by the magical truthfulness of his statements, the judges left Motinui with a choice: plead guilty and face the Run, or plead not guilty by reason of insanity. Motinui chose to plead what he, in his confused and psychologically split mental state, believed to be true - not guilty. </p>
            <p>The rest of the party, hearing this news, headed to Fort Nyanzaru to say their goodbyes to Motinui, who was due to be sent off to rehab at the Temple of Sune for the foreseeable future. As they left, they noticed a large gnoll who had just won the unchained dinosaur race of the day. They later went to the Thundering Lizard to drink, where he introduced himself as Trippin when they met again. Following that, they headed back to Kaya's for the night, re-meeting Salida there as well.</p>

        <summary>Session 20: Party Reconstitution</summary>
        <div>
            <p>1-2 Eleasias: With their party now guideless and down an adventurer, and low on resources, it was time for the party to recover truly from the jungle and the fallout shortly after. Each member going on their way to pick up their personal supplies, they later reconvened to find new party members.</p>
            <p>First was the guide. With River and Flask likely not willing to return to the party, said party headed to the docks, where various guides had posted advertisements on a board near the harbormaster's office. Browsing the blurbs of Azaka, Eku, Faroul/Gondolo, Hew Hackinstone, Musharib, and their recurring pal Salida, they instead decided to chat with Eku, enticed by her righteous words. Speaking with her in her home, she saw right through their caginess about their intentions at Jahaka bay, but eventually agreed to come with them once they admitted their purpose. However, in exchange, she asked the party to help extinguish the life of a hag named Nanny Pu'pu residing in M'bala - a great evil, in her eyes.</p>
            <p>Next was their 5th party member. Not entirely knowing who to go to other than the burly looking gnoll Trippin they had met earlier, they approached him in the Thundering Lizard. Chiwa cut to the chase and explained their plans, to which Trippin laughed (as he seemed to do at just about every statement) and agreed to join them, seemingly looking for adventure. They still didn't know much about him, but he seemed genuine, and despite the grim sense of humor, not a lunatic - a marked improvement.</p>
            <p>Finally was a bonus party member: as the party exited the inn to head back to… the other inn… they were approached by a young half-elven woman named Xandala with a pseudodragon named Summerwise who pleaded to go into the jungle with them. Promising that she could handle herself with her magic and help pay for any fees, she explained her purpose: to find her father, Artus Cimber. The party agreed to take her along, and planned to leave the Port the next day.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>3-8 Eleasias: With the party assembled, they made their final preparations and purchases and headed once more on canoe down the Soshenstar. The first few days went fairly quietly due to their familiarity with this early stretch of river, and a fortunate lack of disturbances on the way.</p>
            <p>9 Eleasias: On the 9th, the party arrived once again at Camp Righteous, where the party decided it was time for another go at uncovering the secrets of the House of Man and Crocodile. Still unsure of what triggered the pit and axe traps, they circumvented them with a casting of spider climb on Wallace. He crawled up the walls and seemed to make significant progress, uncovering a puzzle floor and a matching pattern on a wooden door above it. However, when he interacted with the pattern on the door, he was blasted away and fell haphazardly onto the puzzle floor, subsequently being blasted with flames. The traps had bested them again, and Wallace et al. scurried away. Eku, who wasn't pleased they were disturbing the shrine in the first place, urged them to keep moving towards Mbala. Xandala seemed not interested in the scenario altogether.</p>
            <p>10 Eleasias: Continuing down the river, the party was approaching Camp Vengeance when they heard cries of help coming from the riverbank. Three women were hailing them, a broken canoe beside them, asking for food and support. Sensing a trap, Hugo used his Divine Sense to try to see if these women were who they say they were. They didn't light up, but a different woman did - Eku, apparently a celestial.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the three women were in fact hags, and their human forms melted away into hideous, slimy visages. Although they looked fearsome at first, once one went down and the coven was broken, the other two scattered. Eventually chased down by Wallace, Evie, and Trippin, the hags were slain. Eku thanked them while lambasting Chiwa, Hugo, and Xandala for not chasing after. In the resulting heat, Chiwa revealed Eku's celestial nature, which she did not deny, but didn't provide details (nor was she pressed for them). The party grabbed the hags' treasure (a vial of poison and some non-magical art items) stored in their bait canoe and continued on down the river.</p>

        <summary>Session 22: Mbala</summary>
        <div>
            <p>11-14 Eleasias: The party continued on their way to Mbala. They first passed by Camp Vengeance, which eerily had a coordinated undead presence, with zombified ogres and skeletons seeming to stand guard. Steering clear having not nearly enough presence to challenge the camp, the party stowed their canoes shortly after, as they would have to travel along the edge of the Aldani Basin on foot. As they trudged on the edge of the swamp, they escaped most trouble, although they did have the opportunity to gaze upon the multicolored glean of a flail snail that had traveled close to the basin. However, their real challenge laid ahead of them: the daunting cliffs of Mbala.</p>
            <p>15 Eleasias: As the party arrived at the base of Mbala and began to prepare for the hike up the  narrow stone stairs, they learned some unfortunate news: Eku had seemingly been prevented from entering Mbala by a powerful ward surrounding the cliffs, presumably placed there by Nanny Pu'pu herself. Pressing onwards without her, and vowing to return with the deed done, the party and Xandala began to climb, hiking high, high up above the tree line. This offered a pristine vantage point of the surrounding jungle, and the party noticed a few points of interest: A mote of floating earth far in the Aldani Basin, a ziggurat to the west among the Mistcliff Mountains (Orolunga), and what seemed to be a crashed ship in the trees to the south, somehow.</p>
            <p>However, in Mbala, there was only death - piles of skulls and abandoned buildings. The one unabandoned building was a small hut, where an old, old woman came out of. Before she really had a chance to say anything, Wallace immediately fired, not wanting to hear a word out of her mouth. Although she was wiley, using invisibility, passing through walls, and utilizing her flesh golem and psychic primate minions as defense, Hugo's detect evil and good was the key to keeping her on the radar, and she couldn't escape in time before she was picked down by the might of Trippin and the arcane prowess of Chiwa, while Xandala, Evie, and Wallace held off her minions. Bruised, but victorious, the party sensed they had grown stronger together, more ready to take on the next great danger, wherever that may be.</p>

        <summary>Session 23: Betrayal at Orolunga</summary>
        <div>
            <p>15 Eleasias, continued: With the evil hag Nanny Pu'pu conquered, the party located her treasure (some gems, a scroll, and adamantine ingots bearing the Dwarven runes "Hrakhamar") and returned to Eku who had set up camp for the evening. She smiled seeing the hag's head in Wallace's hands, and thanked our party for vanquishing this great evil. Having seen Orolunga from atop Mbala, the party agreed to head there next, accepting a short detour from their main goal of Jahaka Bay.</p>
            <p>16-29 Eleasias: The party wound their way back to their canoes near Camp Vengeance before trudging through the Aldani Basin and the River Tath towards Orolunga. About halfway through this journey, they came across the bizarre sight of a frigid cold wintery sphere on the river, with rain freezing as it entered the radius and full animals frozen within. Lost as to what could cause it, the group continued on their way.</p>
            <p>30 Eleasias: On their final day of travel, the party wandered through some old ruins, where they were ambushed by two kamadans – huge leopards with poisonous snakes growing on their heads. Although Chiwa in particular took a beating, they were quickly dispatched. However, when they heard faint mewing, they realized that there were two young kamadans without any snakes (or perhaps just normal leopards, adopted?) that they had orphaned, and they picked them up to protect them from the dangers of the jungle.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/DND/ToA/Kamadan.jpg" alt="A leopard-like creature with several snakes protruding from its neck">
                <figcaption><p class="figsubtitle">A Kamadan</p></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Eventually, the party arrived at Orolunga, finding a 3 story ziggurat with an enclosed shrine at the top – but no sign of Artus Cimber. The first set of stairs was covered in impassable, sharp thorns, but they watched as a chwinga was able to waltz through unharmed when carrying a purple and orange orchid. The party found a patch of these orchids and mimicked its behavior. The second stairs were crumbling, and the only way through was to mimic a second chwinga, walking as lightly as the parrot feather it carried. The last set of stairs was crawling with snakes. The party was horrified to see a third chwinga calm one of the snakes and have it slither into its mouth, allowing it to slither up the steps. Evie attempted to follow suit, but physically recoiled as the snake snuck close, her mind somewhat scarred. Hugo, however, was able to do so successfully.</p>
            <p>As Hugo reached the top, none other than Artus Cimber and Dragonbait emerged from the shrine. The party introduced Xandala. However, as Artus said "I don't have any ch--", Xandala quickly cast a spell, commanding in a malicious voice: "Give me the ring." A chaotic battle ensued, as Artus, charmed, tossed a frost-coated ring to Xandala, who began to fly away at incredible speed, although not before Trippin launched a huge attack into her. A jungle chase ensued. Artus pointed his dagger at her, teleporting onto her and grappling her to the ground. However, her frequent use of misty step, shield, and incredible speed made her hard to catch. Eku then revealed her true form – that of a winged serpent, a couatl – and daggered after Xandala, keeping on her tail. It seemed as though Xandala was going to escape with the ring as she flew above the treeline, but at the last moment, Percy climbed a tree with Evie on his back, allowing her to make a long distance shot, dropping Xandala hard on the jungle floor, where Eku dove in for the kill.</p>
            <p>Artus quickly grabbed the ring from her corpse, and profusely thanked the party for helping stop her, realizing that they must have been duped. He explained he was the guardian of the ring, a powerful artifact that needed to not fall into evil hands. He explained the wintery scene on the river had been his doing. However, he seemed reluctant to travel with the party, having his own goals and not wanting to bring attention to the ring with the added party presence, nor to endanger the party further. He encouraged the party to meet with Saja N'baza and bid them farewell once again. The party climbed the steps of Orolunga once again, where the snakes parted ways for them, and they entered the shrine.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="img/DND/ToA/Ring of Winter.jpg" alt="A golden ring covered in blue frost">

            </figure>
            <p>???: The party emerged in a mystical, golden shrine, filled with aromas of incense, cushions, and birds, and the wise Saja N'baza slinked over to them. She thanked them for defeating the great evil she sensed from the shrine, and asked them what they seeked in this place. She had only vaguely heard of the death curse, but when informed, she provided omens pointing to the lost city of Omu, informing them that Ras Nsi, the warlord, yet lived, having cheated death, and that he planned to end the world from Omu. She also hinted that the Flaming Fist had a wide network of allegiances, and although she did not concern herself too deeply with this sort of mortal matter, thought that the party might be able to cut a strand of their web, if not solve the problem entirely. Before the party left, the wise naga bestowed upon each of the party members a charm to aid them in their quest – in exchange for their promise to vanquish Ras Nsi.</p>
            <p>1 Eleint: The party emerged from the shrine, and although the sun was setting when they went in, it was now rising. The party descended the steps, and blue tulips bloomed around them.</p>

        <summary>Session 24: The Capture of Jahaka Anchorage</summary>
        <div>
            <p>1-14 Eleint: With new knowledge in hand, the party continued on their way to Jahaka Bay, reassured their suspicions of piracy would be founded by Saja N'baza's guidance. As they headed down the River Tath back from Orolunga, they passed through the gorgeous Ataaz Kahakla and its many-colored fossils and lifeforms. They also managed to avoid a bout of mad monkey mist that seemed to have infested the mind of an erratic brontosaurus, climbing along the edge of the gorge with an elaborate rope system. They continued into the bay, where they left their canoes and finished the journey on foot, and also spotted the red dragon Tzindelor (or Tinder) flying south over the Kobold Mountains.</p>
            <p>15 Eleint: As the party encroached close to the point on their map on foot, stealth mode activated - Evie's pass without trace and Chiwa's invisibility allowed the party to get right up unseen, where they found an anchorage, complete with pirate guards, a ship riding at anchor, and a second ship docked - the same glittering vessel that had attacked them months ago. In addition, in a cage across the water, they saw the unmistakable gnomish form of Volo himself, in a sticky situation. Wallace attempted to swim across the water to free him, but attracted trouble when a band of sharks attacked him. As the pirates began to suspect something was amiss, the party began to infiltrate, disguised as a pirate (Chiwa), invisible (Hugo and Trippin), whatever worked. By the time the alarm bell was rung, the whole party was effectively inside, and the assault began.</p>
            <p>Over the course of a couple minutes, the party heroically mowed down dozens of pirates, despite all odds seeming against them. Although they were seriously outnumbered, the party's magic, tactics, and brute strength outlasted the waves of pirates, despite the ship at anchor providing supporting fire with ballistae and poorly aimed crossbow shots. Seeing that hope was lost, the fancily dressed captain of the ship at dock escaped, although just barely, by quickly rowing a cutter out to the second ship, where he was helped aboard. However, although the captain did escape, the party had successfully captured the Anchorage, and plenty of prisoners.</p>

        <summary>Session 25: Cutting Down on Dead Weight</summary>
        <div>
            <p>15 Eleint, continued: With the pirates successfully vanquished, the party began to search for incriminating evidence, as well as to free Volo. Attempting to get closer to Volo's cage, Trippin and Wallace headed to the warehouse in an attempt to find a passage through, but did not find any. Then, Wallace made a fatal mistake: he touched one of the boxes of cargo.</p>
            <p>Immediately, 10 swords stuck into the wall animated and began to attack the two intruders, both still badly wounded from the battle. With things looking grim, Wallace jumped out the window into the bay to escape the slashing swords and beckoned for Trippin to follow, but in the moment before he could follow, the swords attacking Wallace moved to Trippin, and cut him down unconscious. With the rest of the party still running up to the upper levels, there was nothing anyone could do….</p>
            <p>TRIPPIN IS DEAD.</p>
            <p>Although the blades were eventually beaten down, it was too late to save Trippin, who had already bled out. The party grimly reconvened to say their goodbyes, and gave their gnoll friend a warrior's funeral, setting a pyre on a boat and allowing it to drift out to sea. Although the death stung deeply, the party did find some important evidence - a ship's ledger on the Emerald Eye - as well as a fair amount of gold and items. The party also attempted to interrogate one of the pirates, who called himself Old Man Lanthar, but he was clearly far too drunk to give any useful information - they would try again later.</p>
            <p>That night, as the party watched over their prisoners and intermittently bonked them back to sleep, they saw a striking-looking myconid that approached, sneezed spores on them, and loudly, telepathically introduced himself as Flump, an ancient myconid with very little social grace. The party, tired and grieving, did not really want to deal with this, and asked him to come back later. He returned the next day, passed the party's admission interview, and was allowed to stay.</p>
            <p>16 Eleint: In addition, in the morning, the party was able to successfully interrogate the pirates, including Lanthar (sans 'Old Man') and his sorry bunch, as well as the old tavern proprietor Bosco Daggerhand. From them, they got the confession that they truly were working with the Flaming Fist, although Bosco was the only one who seemed to know the full truth; the rank and file seemed to only vaguely know of the deal. Nonetheless, the party knew they had good, if not 100% definitive, evidence to clear their names.</p>

        <summary>Session 26: Testimony to Goldenthrone... and to Each Other</summary>
        <div>
            <p>16 Eleint: With not much left to do in Jahaka Anchorage, the party gave one last look over the Anchorage (making sure to grab a bit of loot from Bosco's chambers) and then set out. Although it was a bit of tight quarters to steer out of the cave and through the submerged rocks serving as defense, Hugo put his sailing skills to use and led the crew, a mix of adventures, pirates, and one Volothamp Geddarm, onto the open sea, leaving only superficial damage to the Emerald Eye. However, not everyone was along for the ride - Bosco jumped overboard, attempting to swim to shore. His death at the party's hand was inevitable, but in his words, it was not a pirate's way to go. Bosco was killed, his body retrieved and decapitated in case there was any bounty on him. Following this, Eku let the party know that she was a friend of the harbormaster Zindar, and would inform him of their impending arrival in his dreams that night.</p>
            <p>17-27 Eleint: After a peaceful travel back to the Port other than a distinctly non-peaceful extortion by Aremag once again, the party came into Port with a makeshift white flag raised. Zindar, the harbormaster and a golden half-dragon, flew over to inspect the ship, but aided by his acquaintance with Eku, allowed them in without much trouble. They would, of course have to be questioned as usual. However, they were rewarded with a sack of gold for the bounty on the ship, and allowed to go on their way. They crashed at Kaya's House of Repose, as usual.</p>

            <p>28 Eleint: The party was woken in the morning by a messenger calling them to testify to Goldenthrone that afternoon. Thus, after some brief free time in the morning, they headed to Goldenthrone to testify in front of the Merchant Princes - one of whom was Mother Sibonseni, standing in for Jessamine. Although they got off to a bad start when Flump tried to walk up and plant spores on the MPs, he left (having no real information on the Flaming Fist anyway) and the party spilled the beans. The MPs, seemingly perturbed by the fact that their story was verified by the zone of truth, granted the party asylum from the Flaming Fist and sent them out so that they could deliberate. The party then headed to the Thundering Lizard, where Flump, unable to become intoxicated, beat a dwarf at a drinking contest, and the rest of the party opened up to each other over a drinking game.</p>

        <summary>Session 27: The Price of Knowledge</summary>
        <div>
            <p>29 Eleint – 20 Marpenoth: Following their return from the jungle and having been granted asylum by the Merchant Princes as friends of the city, the party made the decision to spend a few weeks in the city training, learning, and preparing for their biggest expedition yet.</p>
            <p>Hugo capitalized on the time to get his maul enchanted by the ever-busy Wakanga O'Tamu. He also discovered an underground community of Umberlee worshippers, with whom he strengthened his connection to his god. Wallace hired a personal trainer to help him maintain a high intensity training regimen, boosting his athleticism for when it would undoubtedly be needed later. Flump, on the other hand, hired a life coach to help integrate him into society and explain social interaction, with an emphasis on understanding people's emotions and reading for lies.</p>
            <p>Evie and Chiwa, on the other hand, headed the party's research endeavours, using a small collection at the Temple of Savras, gathering info from townsfolk, and occasional forays into private collections of the MPs to attempt to understand Ras Nsi, Omu, and more. The location of Omu was highly sought after, but the most promising lead was a map that had been torn out of a book, leaving them with little more knowledge than they had already, although they felt sure it was near the Peaks of Flame. They also learned some of the history of Omu and its fall.</p>
            <p>Another hot topic was the mysterious Ras Nsi. They learned a brief history of Mezro, and his exile and subsequent war against the city. They attempted to figure out what happened to the fallen bara following his failed war, but only found vague references to the south. The party also briefly researched yuan-ti, with Evie even trying to look up Chiwa's mysterious skull to no avail.</p>
            <p>However, one dramatic event did occur amidst this downtime: On 13 Marpenoth, the church bells rung out: Jessamine has died. A strange mood fell upon the city as the first ever change of a Merchant Prince occurred in the city's history (the MPs being a relatively recent change to government structure), with Mother Sibonseni formally taking Jessamine's place. Although the party knew they couldn't have saved her given how long it would have taken them to trek south in Chult, the stakes of the Death Curse were clearly laid bare.</p>

        <summary>Session 28: Exploring the Ruins of Mezro... Or Are They?</summary>
        <div>
            <p>21 – 28 Marpenoth: Refreshed and equipped with better weapons and new knowledge, the party and Eku headed back out into the jungle for perhaps the final time. Now seasoned jungle veterans, the party began canoeing down the River Tiryki, before crossing through a narrow part of the undead-infested jungle towards Port Castigliar. Although the undead did not actually prove much trouble for a large party of experienced adventurers, it was clear that the jungle there was less healthy than usual.</p>
            <p>29 Marpenoth: Finally arriving at the beach of Port Castigliar, the party found a long-abandoned settlement mostly washed away by the sands. This was not much of a surprise, as they knew the settlement was taken by the undead long ago. What was a surprise was the visitors – on the shore, an enormous longboat with sails seemingly made of white dragon wings was anchored. From far away, Wallace spotted a skeleton crew of an unusual species: Frost Giants! Two of the huge, blue figures waited on the shore while another 2 kept watch on the ship. The party, not wanting to be noticed, kept their distance, and after an hour retreated further into the jungle to rest.</p>
            <p>30 Marpenoth - 1 Uktar: Upon waking up, the frost giant ship was still docked at the beach, and one of the guards appeared to be a different giant than the first crew. Not knowing how many more frost giants could be below deck, and assuming they weren't leaving anytime soon, the party decided to give the giants a wide berth and go around them to get to Mezro.</p>
            <p>As they headed to Mezro, Wallace was first to hear heavy footsteps from ahead. The party ducked for the cover of the overgrowth as a band of 3 frost giants and 2 winter wolves passed by, muttering in Giant as they passed. It was then that Hugo made a connection: Frost Giants... Ring of Winter... could they be after Artus? It seemed reasonable enough, although there was no proof. The party headed on their way once more.</p>
            <p>2 Uktar: After avoiding making a giant mess (obligatory pun requirement fulfilled) the party finally arrived at the ruins of Mezro. There they saw 4 quarters of a city, all flooded and overgrown, with an opulent temple at the center and a shantytown on the outskirts. However, the whole area was swampy and buggier than usual, and worse, an unsettling aura surrounded the ruins, like a storm about to break.</p>
            <p>Deciding to head towards civilization first, the party canoed through the swamp towards the shantytown, before spotting Flaming Fist insignias on docked ships and immediately turning around. They instead decided to move into one of the quarters of the city. There they found an old statue dedicated to King Osaw I, but more interestingly, noticed people, not obviously Flaming Fist but not all Chultan either, watching them from across a stream. Approaching peacefully, they were welcomed by a dwarf named Emberon Coalscuttle, who shared with them visions he had received from "the mudmaw", a type of tentacled crocodile nobody has heard of ever giving people visions. These visions included prophecies of a godling infant, the death curse, "The Forsaken One" (whatever that might be) and others. However, getting uncomfortable vibes, the party moved along, not wanting to know what this mudmaw was or why these cultists really worshipped it.</p>
            <p>As they attempted to cross the canal to another district, they unfortunately made a bit of a splash as Hugo snapped a vine and fell into the water (nonobligatory pun requirement fulfilled). This drew over a Flaming Fist patrol from near the temple, who demanded to see paperwork, which the party wanted no part of. Initial attempts by Wallace to intimidate the patrol failed and they were shot on, but further words of warning from Eku and Chiwa (and one of the guards faces being eldritch blasted off, although that admittedly wasn't the goal) was enough to convince a retreat.</p>
            <p>The party continued onwards toward an old library, which had also been ransacked mostly. While there, Chiwa detected an aura of wild magic permeating the air. They then headed into a back room where a mage named Ilyazni was poised to attack the intruding party, but the situation was defused and they began to talk to the mad mage about her research, spread across the walls like a conspiracy board. She suspected that the ruins of Mezro were not as they seemed, and that what they stood in was some sort of fake or illusion. She hinted that the Temple of Ubtao in the center of the ruins would explain why.</p>

        <summary>Session 29: Into the Temple of Ubtao</summary>
        <div>
            <p>2 Uktar, continued: With their work in the library done, the party began to head to the opulent Temple of Ubtao. As they approached, the temple always seemed to be facing them at the same angle - perfect symmetry, or some sort of illusion? Perhaps both. As they entered the grand double doors, they came into a hallway filled with statues. Noticing King Osaw I's statue in the hall, they surmised these were statues of the barae, but they did not see any that were defaced or corresponded to Ras Nsi. At the other end of the hallway was a magically darkened hallway.</p>
            <p>This hallway proved to be quite the confusion, as it led various people to completely different rooms within the abandoned temple, including an old library, an apothecary, a prayer dome, and most intriguingly, a throne room. This throne room, covered in labyrinthian patterns like the entire temple, seemed to have a layout of the city of Mezro on the ground, with miniscule people walking about the city. It didn't seem to correspond to the ruins as they knew them; could this be the real Mezro? There was no way to tell. Wallace was the first to figure out the secret of the archway, which was that the destination could be controlled by thinking about where to go.</p>
            <p>After a short rest in the old kitchen, the party emerged into the original hall, where their old friends the Flaming Fist were waiting! Strongly requesting the party come to their camp, Camp Promise, to parlay with Commander Brokenbarrel, the party seemed unlikely to cooperate, but Flump agreed to be a "neutral" arbiter (his neutrality being somewhat questionable in this scenario). He went alone to Promise, and after a quick grilling by Brokenbarrel, a gruff goliath woman, was able to set up a neutral location for a peace meeting. And, although the peace meeting was generally rather acrimonious, it went surprisingly well. With nearly 60 of their people there, the Flaming Fist didn't want to get into a fight and lose many of them, but the party was not looking to get themselves killed. So, in exchange for a bit of information, the party was allowed to simply leave Mezro rather than face the Flaming Fist's wrath.</p>
