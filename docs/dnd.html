    <h2>Tomb of Annihilation</h2>
    <p>I currently DM a Tomb of Annihilation campaign for five good friends I met through previous D&D campaigns and have stuck with since. They've been exploring Chult since August 2021 and I've been keeping session logs for every session, unless I forget to. Please enjoy the adventures of Hugo, Evie, Dr. Wallace Woodward, Chiwa, and <span class="strikeout">Motinui</span> <span class="strikeout">Trippin</span> Flump!</p>

        <summary>Session 1: The Party Assembles... Sans One</summary>
        <div>
            <p>We start our adventure on the fine 2nd day of Kythorn, 1494. A lizardfolk postdoc, Dr. Wallace Woodward; a halfling professor, Dr. Evelyn (Evie) Brightwood; and a tabaxi fisherman, Hugo; have been sailing aboard the Silver Sailor on their way to Chult for about a week now. Led on the water by the gruff Captain Tyrol Quicksilver, our three heroes spend some time getting to know the flamboyant gnome Volo, as well as a half-orc priestess of Torm, Undril Silvertusk. A quiet figure of a Chultan man also lurks, standing more solitary.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, with a splashing sound, the passengers see a purple triton backpedaling towards the boat with a set of four drums. Helping him aboard, they learn his name is Motinui, and he begins to play some Hawaiian-sounding music to raise the spirits of the crew. With Dr. Woodward feeling hungry, Hugo offers to try to catch him some fish, but it is Motinui who is able to get the first bite. However, more bites would be coming soon, as the rest of the party noticed a pack of 5 plesiosauruses fighting over an octopus, 3 of which decided that the party looked tastier.</p>
            <p>Motinui jumped into the water and tried to communicate a sense of danger to the beasts. He successfully deterred one, but the other two were unfazed, and the closer of them took a huge bite out of Motinui, nearly swallowing him in one bite. They eventually repelled the beast, which fled after being badly injured. They were able to finish off the other one and hoist it aboard for its meat, but not before it got a good bite into Hugo, who had also jumped in to protect Motinui.</p>
            <p>The next morning, feeling somewhat rested, the party awoke to a stormier day. Off in the distance, they noticed a ship nearly silhouetted, but that seemed to glimmer just a bit. The ship began to gain on them, and it became clear they flew a black pirate flagâ€¦.</p>
