        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello once again, and welcome to my extended introduction. Let's get to know each other a bit more, shall we? (Well, I won't get to know you, only vice versa. That's fine too.)</p>
        <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
        <div class="about" id="hometown">
            <figure>
                <img src="img/400px-Bennington_Battle_Monument.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>The Bennington Battle Monument, which I somehow never actually went up</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <div>
                <p>I spent my entire childhood in the lovely Green Mountain State, Vermont. For most of my childhood I lived in Bennington, a small town of about 15,000 people that somehow is still the 6th largest city/town in Vermont. This is due to the uh, lack of people in our tiny little state. However, it's got a lot of charm.</p>
                <p>Although Vermont is and will always be in my blood, I actually don't live there anymore - I currently live in Concord, New Hampshire (that is, when I am not at school). Also a nice place, although to be perfectly frank I haven't had much of a chance to explore it since I'm only there on breaks from school.</p>

        <h2>School (and beyond School)</h2>
        <div class="about" id="school-and-beyond">

            <div>
                <p>I've been in school for, well, a while now. Right now I am a third-year student at the University of Pittsburgh, where I study Computer Science and Data Science. Right now, I'm just pursuing a Bachelor of Science; I have considered going to graduate school, but for now I haven't found anything that I truly need the degree for. If I do decide to get an extra degree, it will probably be after some time in the workforce.</p>
                <p>In terms of other fun things I do at school, as you might know from the homepage, I am the president for the Pitt Men's Glee Club (I sing upper Bass). Singing has been a part of my life for at least since high school, and over the years I've bounced between most of the voice parts, from a pre-puberty Soprano voice to a temporary Tenor, and then to a Bass. I have switched between Baritone and Bass as needed, and can more or less sing both. I only originally got into singing through theatre (musicals being the "gateway drug"), which has been a part of my life for far longer, ever since my breakout role of Peaseblossom in A Midsummer Night's Dream when I was 5. I haven't had as much time to commit to theatre in my college days, unfortunately!</p>
                <p>I've also been playing Dungeons and Dragons for a long time (since I was 7 or 8, with my family). I started with 3.5e, mostly skipped over 4e, and now have firmly settled into 5e. This is something that has continued into college - I found a great group through the Rollplayers club at Pitt and we've been gaming since my freshman year, even through Covid. Relatedly, I'm a big fan of board games, specifically the complicated ones. Favorites include Spirit Island, Istanbul, Castles of Mad King Ludvig, Sushi Go, and many more!</p>

        <h2>Why Computer and Data Science?</h2>
        <div class="about" id="whyCSDS">
            <div>
                <p>There are a few reasons I study CS. One very obvious one is that I enjoy coding. Related to that is the sense of puzzling I get from trying to solve programming and CS problems, and the sense of satisfaction I get when that puzzle gets solved. Additionally, CS is a very broad field, which appeals to me because I'm still not sure what I'd like to do with my life and my career; I know I have some flexiblity with my degree.</p>
                <p>As for Data Science, that sort of just worked out. The major is very new to Pitt and was introduced between my first and second years, and I noticed that the overlap between it and CS was pretty heavy and I had already taken or planned to take many of the courses due to personal interest, so it seemed like a good fit and a way to refine my interests.</p>

                <p>Great question!</p>
