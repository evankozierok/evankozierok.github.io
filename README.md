# Evan Kozierok's Personal Website

Hello, and welcome to the page for my personal website!

## Accessing

The website is accessible live at https://evankozierok.github.io

You can also simply clone the repository and start at `docs/index.html`. The site is mostly static HTML/CSS with a few flavors of JS so you should be able to load it in a local browser without any trouble.

## Assets

See `assets.md`.
