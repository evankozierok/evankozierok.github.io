# Evan Kozierok's Personal Website

Hello, and welcome to the page for my personal website! It's still really quite early (I've had no time :I ...) so apologies for the barebones look.

## Accessing

The website should be live at https://evankozierok.github.io/webs2022spring/, or you can just clone and start at `docs/index.html`. All links should work with the exception of my PDF resume which I need to update and will be procrastinating until the last minute. No special instructions here, it's plain HTML/CSS for the moment.

## Assets

I, uh, haven't gotten around to it yet....
