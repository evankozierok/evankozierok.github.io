# Proposal

For my website project, I plan to make a personal/professional website to display to employers, colleagues, etc. displaying and discussing the various work I have done, both traditional CS work and other projects (like any... audio or visual projects cough cough cough). I plan to start on a home page with some sort of flashy logo (I have a way I like to stylize my name sometimes because the geometric shape of the letters EVAN is rather harmonious) and probably some sort of general info about me, with links to other pages with various projects, interests, etc. I'd like these to be distinct pages to give things a bit of separation. (I dislike websites where the links are just scrolling sections, my reasoning being that I like to click on all the links on a page to make sure I don't miss anything and then I end up clicking on to parts of a page I've already seen. Is this a rational complaint? Who's to say.)

In terms of layout, I'm not 100% sure yet - I think a traditional top menu is always a good option, but I may play around with different locations, especially on the nice flashy landing page, where more space can be dedicated to navigation because there isn't necessarily as much content. In terms of sections I'd like, I'll obviously have the landing page, pages for an "interactive resume" - what I mean here is things on my resume but ideally with pictures, media, or depending on the situation, something more interactive (maybe for a game, a gif of gameplay or even the ability to play directly! We'll see) - as well as pages for other work I've done (like projects for this class) and maybe extended personal hobbies/interests (example: session logs for my D&D campaign to read for fun).

Notably, I want this website to be a living document that I can continually update with cool things I do and serve as an online presence that represents my personality and interests.
