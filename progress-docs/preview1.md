# Preview 1
### March 22
For my first preview, I have a very (very) barebones website, mainly just showing/describing the sorts of content that will likely go on each page, as well as a basic navigation menu. There is some minimal styling on the menu using flexbox properties as well as a little bit of stylistic flair here and there, but the overall website theme is something I really still don't have, and am not yet sure how to decide on. In addition, the actual content still definitely needs to be fleshed out, as some pages (About Me especially) are still all but empty. 

On a more meta level, I need to remind myself not to try to write the entire website in one go, which is what I find myself thinking a lot. This is not a particularly helpful frame of mind for me, as it then becomes a daunting task to do anything. Part of the benefit of HTML and CSS is that I don't have to do them both at the same time. Probably, what I should focus on is:

1) Write all my content, whenever I have the creative energy to do so (and time, since I've planned out a fair amount of content. Dare I say... too much? I honestly don't know!)
2) With content structured, make a mockup. In ideal circumstances, I'd brush up on Figma, but there's absolutely no way I'm going to have the time. Probably a decent quality color drawing will do
3) Build up CSS one rule at a time

It's probably also worth confronting my nature as a perfectionist, which has come up before in this class. I think I need to convince myself that this website is more art than code and as such it can't be perfect, by defintion. And that, in addition, I plan to keep updating this website beyond the immediate deadlines of this unit, so I needn't get too bogged down by trying to have it absolutely finished by a certain date.
