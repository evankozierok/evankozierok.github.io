    <h1>Links</h1>
    <p>We must keep our word. Here are <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

    <p>But we can be more organized...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Absolute Links:</strong> like to 
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>.
            Best for outside links. The '_blank' opens in a new tab/window.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Relative links:</strong> such as
            <a href="misc/extras.html">Extras</a>.
            No scheme or domain necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Root-relative links:</strong> these dont work for this tutorial, but
            <a href="/">this</a>
            would take us to the home page, were we to have one. The '/' is the root directory.
        </li>
