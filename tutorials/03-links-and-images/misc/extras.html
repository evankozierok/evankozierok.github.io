    <h2>Character Sets</h2>

    <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish. It seems chrome now
        defaults to UTF-8 but probably a good idea to specify anyway.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>bir</li>
        <li>iki</li>
        <li>üç</li>
        <li>dört</li>
        <li>beş</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
        <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
        should always use HTML entities for these three characters. There are many.</p>
